exchange therefor the Merger Consideration for each Company Common Share formerly represented by such Certificate or held in book-entry form, as applicable, and the shares so surrendered shall forthwith be canceled.  If\\n        payment of the Merger Consideration is to be made to a Person other than the Person in whose name the surrendered Certificate or share held in book-entry form is

paid or\\n        is not applicable.  Until surrendered as contemplated by this Section 2.02(c), each Company Common Share, and any Certificate with respect thereto shall be deemed at any time from and after the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive\\n        upon such surrender the Merger Consideration which the holders of Company Common Shares were entitled to receive in respect of such shares pursuant to Section 2.01.  No interest shall be paid or shall accrue on the cash payable upon surrender of\\n        any Certificate (or any Company Common Shares held in

II.\",\"(e)\",\"Termination of Exchange Fund\",\".  Any portion of the Exchange Fund (including any interest received with respect\\n        thereto) that remains undistributed to the holders of Company Common Shares for one year after the Effective Time shall be delivered to Parent, upon demand, and any holder of Company Common Shares (other than Excluded Shares) who has not\\n

to a public official in compliance with any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law.  Any portion of the Exchange Fund which remains undistributed to the holders of Company Common\\n        Shares immediately prior to such date on which the Exchange Fund otherwise would be required to escheat to, or become the property of, any Governmental Entity, shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, become the property of Parent, free\\n        and clear of all claims or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto.\",\"(g)\",\"Investment of Exchange Fund\",\".  Pending its disbursement in accordance with this Section 2.02, the Exchange Fund\\n        shall be invested by the Paying Agent as directed by Parent.  Any interest and other income resulting from such investments shall be paid to Parent.  Parent shall or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to promptly replace or restore the cash in\\n        the Exchange Fund so as to ensure that the Exchange Fund is at all times maintained at a level sufficient for the Paying Agent to make all payments of Merger Consideration in accordance herewith.  No investment losses resulting from investment of\\n        the funds deposited with the Paying Agent shall diminish the rights of any holder of Company Common Shares to receive the Merger Consideration as provided herein.\",\"(h)\",\"Withholding Rights\",\".  Each of Parent, the Surviving Corporation and the Paying Agent (without duplication) shall\\n        be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable to any holder of Company Common Shares pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as may be required to be deducted and withheld with respect to the making of such payment\\n        under the Code, or any other applicable state, local or non-U.S. Tax Law.  To the extent that amounts are so withheld and remitted to the applicable Governmental Entity, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of

each of the Financing Letters is in full force and effect and the respective obligations and commitments therein have not been withdrawn, rescinded or terminated or otherwise amended or modified in any\\n      respect.  As of the date hereof, no event has occurred which (with or without notice, lapse of time, or both) would reasonably be expected to constitute a breach in any material respect or default on the part of Parent or, to the Knowledge of Parent,\\n      any of the other parties thereto under the Financing Letters or otherwise result in any portion of the Financing contemplated thereby, as applicable, to be unavailable or delayed.  Subject to the satisfaction of the conditions contained in\",\"Section 7.01\",\"and\",\"Section 7.03\",\"hereof, as of the date hereof, Parent has no reason to believe that any of the conditions in any of the Financing Letters will not be satisfied or\\n      that any of portion of the Financing will not be made available thereunder on a timely basis in order to consummate the Transactions.  As of the date hereof, none of the Guarantors or the Commitment Parties has notified Parent of its intention to\\n      terminate any of its

in full force and effect.  As of the date of this Agreement, no event has occurred which (with or without notice, lapse of time, or both), would or would reasonably be expected to constitute a default or breach on the part of the applicable\\n      Guarantor under any Guarantee.\",\"SECTION 3.09.\",\"Solvency\",\".  Neither Parent nor Merger Sub is entering into this Agreement (and the Guarantors are not entering into the Guarantees)\\n      with the actual intent to hinder, delay or defraud either present or future creditors of the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries.  Assuming (a)

aggregate Merger Consideration, any\",\"9\",\"other repayment or refinancing of debt contemplated in this Agreement or the Financing Letters, payment of all amounts required to be paid in connection with the consummation of the Merger and the other Transactions,\\n      and payment of all related fees and expenses, each of Parent and the Surviving Corporation will be Solvent as of the Effective Time and immediately after the consummation of the applicable transactions.  For the purposes of this Agreement, the term “\",\"Solvent\",\"”,\\n\\n\\n\\n      when used with respect to any Person, means that, as of any date of determination, (a) the amount of the “fair saleable value” of the assets of such Person and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, will, as of such date, exceed the sum of (i) the value\\n      of all “liabilities of such Person and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, including contingent and other liabilities”, as of such date, as such quoted terms are generally determined in accordance with applicable Laws governing determinations of the\\n      insolvency of debtors, and (ii) the amount that will be required to pay the probable liabilities of such Person and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, as of such date, on its existing debts (including contingent and other liabilities) as such debts\\n      become absolute and mature, (b) such Person and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, will not have, as of such date, an unreasonably small amount of capital for the operation of the businesses in which they are engaged or proposed to be engaged\\n      following such date and (c) such Person and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, will be able to pay their liabilities, including contingent and other liabilities, as they mature.  For purposes of this definition, “not have an unreasonably small\\n      amount of capital for the operation of the businesses in which it is engaged or proposed to be engaged” and “able to pay its liabilities, including contingent and other liabilities, as they mature” means that such Person will be able to generate\\n      enough cash from operations, asset dispositions or refinancing, or a combination thereof, to meet its obligations as they become due.\",\"SECTION 3.10.\",\"Certain Arrangements\",\".  As of the date of this Agreement, there are no Contracts or other\\n      arrangements or understandings
