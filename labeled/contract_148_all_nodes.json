with the Delaware Secretary of State and make all other filings or recordings required by the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (the “DGCL”) in connection with the First Merger and (ii) immediately following the filing of the First Certificate of Merger, the First Surviving Corporation shall file a certificate of merger (the “Second Certificate of Merger”) with the Delaware Secretary of State and make all other filings or recordings required by the DGCL and Limited Liability Company Act of the State of Delaware (the “DLLCA”) in connection with the Second Merger.  The First Merger

shall agree and is specified in the First Certificate of Merger) and the Second Merger shall become effective at such time (the “Second Effective Time”) as the Second Certificate of Merger is duly filed with the Delaware Secretary of State (or at such later time as Parent and the Company shall agree and is specified in the Second Certificate of Merger, but in any event following the First Effective Time and as soon as practicable following the First Effective Time).\\n\\n \\n\\n(b)                                 (i) At the First Effective Time, Merger Sub I shall be merged with and into the Company in accordance with the DGCL (the “First Merger”), whereupon the separate existence of Merger Sub I shall cease and the Company shall be the surviving corporation (the “First Surviving Corporation”), such that immediately following the First Merger, the First Surviving Corporation shall be a wholly owned direct subsidiary of Bidco and (ii) immediately (or as soon as practicable) following the First Merger, and as part of the same plan, at the Second Effective Time, the First Surviving Corporation shall be merged with and into Merger Sub II in accordance with the DGCL and DLLCA (the “Second Merger” and, together with the First Merger, the “Mergers”), whereupon the separate existence of the First Surviving Corporation shall cease and Merger Sub II shall be the surviving company (the “Surviving Company”), such that immediately following the Second Merger, the Surviving Company shall be a wholly owned direct subsidiary of Bidco.\\n\\n \\n\\n(c)                                  (i) From and after the First Effective Time, the First Surviving Corporation shall possess all the rights, powers, privileges and franchises and be subject to all of the obligations, liabilities, restrictions and disabilities of the Company and Merger Sub I, all as provided under the DGCL and (ii) from and after the Second Effective Time, the

At the First Effective Time, by virtue of the First Merger and without any action on the part of Parent, Bidco, either Merger Sub, the Company or any holder of Company Common Stock, the common stock of Merger Sub I or limited liability interests in Merger Sub II:\\n\\n \\n\\n(a)                                 other than (i) shares of Company Common Stock to be cancelled or converted pursuant to Section 2.03(b) and (ii) Dissenting Shares (such shares together with the shares of Company Common Stock to be cancelled or converted pursuant to Section 2.03(b), collectively, the “Excluded Shares”), each share of Company Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the First Effective Time shall be converted into, and shall thereafter represent only, the right to receive, (A) 2.1243 (the “Exchange Ratio”) Parent ADSs (the “Share Consideration”), subject to Section 2.09 with respect to fractional Parent ADSs, and (B) $60.00 in cash without interest (the “Cash Consideration” and, together with the Share Consideration, the “Merger Consideration”) and, immediately following such conversion, shall be automatically cancelled and cease to exist (the “Cancellation”);\\n\\n \\n\\n(b)                                 (i) each share of Company Common Stock held by the Company as treasury stock or owned by Parent, Bidco or by either Merger Sub immediately prior to the First Effective Time (other than any such shares owned by Parent, Bidco or either Merger Sub in a fiduciary, representative or other capacity on behalf of other Persons, whether or not held in a separate account) shall be cancelled and shall cease to exist, and no consideration shall be paid with respect thereto and (ii) each share of Company Common Stock held by any wholly owned Subsidiary of either the Company or Parent (other than Bidco and either Merger Sub) immediately prior to the First Effective Time shall be converted into a number of validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable Parent ADSs equal to the sum of (A) the Exchange Ratio and (B) the Cash Consideration divided by the Parent ADS Price;\\n\\n \\n\\n(c)                                  each share of common stock of Merger Sub I, par value $0.01 per share, issued and outstanding immediately prior to the First Effective Time shall be converted into and become one validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the First Surviving Corporation; and\\n\\n \\n\\n(d)                                 all outstanding shares of Company Common Stock shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled and retired and shall cease to exist, and (i) each share of Company Common Stock that was, immediately prior to the First Effective Time, represented by a certificate (each, a “Certificate”) and (ii) each uncertificated share of Company Common Stock that, immediately prior to the First Effective Time, was registered to a holder on the stock transfer books of the Company (an “Uncertificated Share”) shall (in each case, other than with respect to Excluded Shares) thereafter represent only the right to receive (A) the Merger Consideration and (B) with respect to the Share Consideration, the right to receive (1) any dividends or other distributions pursuant to Section 2.05(f) and (2) any cash in lieu of any fractional Parent ADSs pursuant to Section 2.09, in each case to be issued or paid in accordance with Section 2.05, without interest.\\n\\n \\n\\nSection 2.04                             Conversion of Shares in the Second Merger.  At the Second Effective Time, by virtue of the Second Merger and without any action on the part of Parent, Bidco, either Merger Sub, the Company or any holder of common stock of the First Surviving\\n\\n \\n\\n23\\n\\n \\n\\nCorporation or common stock of Merger Sub II, (i) each limited liability company interest of Merger Sub II issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Second Effective Time shall remain outstanding as a limited liability company interest of the Surviving Company and shall not be affected by the Second Merger and (ii) each share of common stock of the First Surviving Corporation issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Second Effective Time shall be cancelled and shall cease to exist, and no consideration shall be paid with respect thereto, such that, immediately following the Second Merger, the Surviving Company shall be a direct wholly owned subsidiary of Bidco.\\n\\n \\n\\nSection 2.05                             Surrender and Payment.\\n\\n \\n\\n(a)                                 Prior to the First Effective Time, Parent and Bidco shall appoint a commercial bank or trust company reasonably acceptable to the Company (the “Exchange Agent”) and enter into an exchange agent agreement with the Exchange Agent reasonably acceptable to the Company (the “Exchange Agent Agreement”) for the purpose of exchanging (i) Certificates or (ii) Uncertificated Shares for the Merger Consideration payable in respect of the shares of Company Common Stock.  As of the First Effective Time, in consideration of and in exchange for the issuance to Parent by Bidco of 1,900 shares of common stock of Bidco and the Cancellation, Parent shall allot Parent Ordinary Shares which may be represented in uncertificated form in CREST or American depositary receipts evidencing (or evidence of Parent ADSs in book-entry form representing) the Parent ADSs issuable pursuant to Section 2.03(a).  As of the First Effective Time, Parent (in the case of (x)) and Parent or Bidco (in the case of (y)) shall deposit or cause to be deposited with the Exchange Agent, for the benefit of the holders of shares of Company Common Stock, for exchange in accordance with this Section 2.05 through the Exchange Agent, (x) American depositary receipts evidencing (or evidence of Parent ADSs in book-entry form representing) the Parent ADSs issuable pursuant to Section 2.03(a) in exchange for outstanding shares of Company Common Stock and (y) cash sufficient to pay the aggregate Cash Consideration payable pursuant to Section 2.03(a).  Parent agrees to make available, directly or indirectly, to the Exchange Agent from time to time as needed additional cash sufficient to pay any dividends or other distributions to which such holders are entitled pursuant to Section 2.05(f) and cash in lieu of any fractional Parent ADSs to which such holder is entitled pursuant to Section 2.09.  Promptly after the First Effective Time (and in no event more than two Business Days following the Closing Date), Parent shall send, or shall cause the Exchange Agent to send, to each holder of shares of Company Common Stock at the First Effective Time a letter of transmittal and instructions (which shall be in a form reasonably acceptable to the Company and substantially finalized prior to the First Effective Time and which shall specify that (A) delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title shall pass, only on proper delivery of the Certificates or transfer of the Uncertificated Shares to the Exchange Agent) for use in such exchange and (B) each holder of shares of Company Common Stock may elect to receive a number of Parent Ordinary Shares in lieu of Parent ADSs as Share Consideration pursuant to Section 2.05(g).  All certificates (or evidence of Parent ADSs in book-entry form) and cash deposited with the Exchange Agent pursuant to this Section 2.05 shall be referred to in this Agreement as the “Exchange Fund”.  Parent shall cause, or shall procure that Bidco cause, the Exchange Agent to deliver the Merger Consideration contemplated to be issued or paid pursuant to this Article II out of the Exchange Fund.  The Exchange Fund shall not be used for any other purpose.  The Exchange Agent shall invest any cash included in the Exchange Fund as directed by Parent or Bidco; provided, that such cash shall only be invested in the\\n\\n \\n\\n24\\n\\n \\n\\nmanner provided in the Exchange Agent Agreement; provided, further, that no such investment or losses thereon shall affect the Merger Consideration payable to holders of Company Common Stock entitled to receive such consideration or cash in lieu of fractional interests and, to the extent necessary to pay the Merger Consideration, Parent shall promptly cause, or shall procure that Bidco cause, to be provided additional funds to the Exchange Agent for the benefit of holders of Company Common Stock entitled to receive such consideration in the amount of any such losses.  Any interest and other income resulting from such investments shall be the property of, and paid to, Parent on termination of the Exchange Fund.\\n\\n \\n\\n(b)                                 Each holder of shares of Company Common Stock that have been converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration shall be entitled to receive, on (i) surrender to the Exchange Agent of a Certificate, together with a properly completed and duly executed letter of transmittal, or (ii) receipt of an “agent’s message” by the Exchange Agent (or such other evidence, if any, of transfer as the Exchange Agent may reasonably request) in the case of a book-entry transfer of Uncertificated Shares, the Merger Consideration in respect of each share of the Company Common Stock represented by such Certificate or Uncertificated Share (including cash in lieu of any fractional Parent ADSs and any dividends and distributions with respect to the Share Consideration as contemplated by Section 2.05(f) and Section 2.09).  The Parent ADSs constituting the Share Consideration, at Parent’s option, shall be in uncertificated book-entry form, unless a physical American depository receipt evidencing such Parent ADSs is requested by a holder of shares of Company Common Stock or is otherwise required under Applicable Law.\\n\\n \\n\\n(c)                                  If any portion of the Merger Consideration (or cash in lieu of any fractional Parent ADSs or any dividends and distributions with respect to the Share Consideration as contemplated by Section 2.05(f) and Section 2.09) is to be paid to a Person other than the Person in whose name the surrendered Certificate or the transferred Uncertificated Share is registered, it shall be a condition to such payment that (i) either such Certificate shall be properly endorsed or shall otherwise be in proper form for transfer or such Uncertificated Share shall be properly transferred and (ii) the Person requesting such payment shall pay to the Exchange Agent any stamp duty, stamp duty reserve tax, transfer or similar Taxes required as a result of such payment to a Person other than the registered holder of such Certificate or Uncertificated Share or establish to the satisfaction of the Exchange Agent that such stamp duty, stamp duty reserve tax, transfer or similar Taxes have been paid or are not payable.\\n\\n \\n\\n(d)                                 From and after the First Effective Time, there shall be no further registration of transfers of shares of Company Common Stock thereafter on the records of the Company.  If, after the First Effective Time, Certificates or Uncertificated Shares are presented to Parent, the First Surviving Corporation, the Surviving Company or the Exchange Agent for any reason, they shall be cancelled and exchanged for the Merger Consideration (and cash in lieu of any fractional Parent ADSs and any dividends and distributions with respect to the Share Consideration as contemplated by Section 2.05(f) and Section 2.09) with respect thereto in accordance with the procedures set forth in, or as otherwise contemplated by, this Article II (including this Section 2.05).\\n\\n \\n\\n(e)                                  Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains unclaimed by the holders of shares of Company Common Stock 12 months following the Closing Date shall be delivered\\n\\n \\n\\n25\\n\\n \\n\\nto Parent or as otherwise instructed by Parent, and any such holder who has not exchanged shares of Company Common Stock for the Merger Consideration in accordance with this Section 2.05 prior to that time shall thereafter look only to Parent for payment of the Merger Consideration (and cash in lieu of any fractional Parent ADSs and any dividends and distributions with respect to the Share Consideration as contemplated by Section 2.05(f) and Section 2.09), without any interest thereon.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent and its Subsidiaries (including Bidco, the Surviving Company and its Subsidiaries) shall not be liable to any holder of shares of Company Common Stock for any amounts properly paid to a public official in compliance with applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar laws.  Any amounts remaining unclaimed by holders of shares of Company Common Stock immediately prior to such time when the amounts would otherwise escheat to or become property of any Governmental Authority shall become, to the extent permitted by Applicable Law, the property of Parent free and clear of any claims or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto.\\n\\n \\n\\n(f)                                   Following the surrender of any Certificates, along with the delivery of a properly completed and duly executed letter of transmittal, or the transfer of any Uncertificated Shares, in each case as provided in this Section 2.05, Parent shall pay, or cause to be paid, without interest, to the Person in whose name the Parent ADSs constituting the Share Consideration have been registered, (i) in connection with the payment of the Share Consideration, (x) the amount of any cash payable in lieu of fractional shares to which such Person is entitled pursuant to Section 2.09, and (y) the aggregate amount of all dividends or other distributions payable with respect to such Parent ADSs, with a record date on or after the First Effective Time that were paid prior to the time of such surrender or transfer, and (ii) at the appropriate payment date after the payment of the Merger Consideration, the amount of all dividends or other distributions payable with respect to whole Parent ADSs constituting the Share Consideration with a record date on or after the First Effective Time and prior to the time of such surrender or transfer and with a payment date subsequent to the time of such surrender or transfer.  No dividends or other distributions with respect to Parent ADSs constituting the Share Consideration, and no cash payment in lieu of fractional shares pursuant to Section 2.09, shall be paid to the holder of any Certificates not surrendered or of any Uncertificated Shares not transferred until such Certificates are surrendered and the holder thereof delivers a properly completed and duly executed letter of transmittal or such or Uncertificated Shares are transferred, as the case may be, as provided in this Section 2.05.\\n\\n \\n\\n(g)                                  Notwithstanding anything in this Section 2.05 to the contrary, Parent shall cooperate with the Exchange Agent and ADS Depository, as necessary, to provide for (i) the ability of holders of Company Common Stock to elect to receive Parent Ordinary Shares in lieu of Parent ADSs and (ii) the delivery of such Parent Ordinary Shares in lieu of Parent ADSs as the Share Consideration (and in satisfaction of such obligation) to the extent elected by the holders of shares of Company Common Stock pursuant to Section 2.05(a).  The number of Parent Ordinary Shares to be delivered in lieu of Parent ADSs shall be the number of underlying Parent Ordinary Shares represented by such Parent ADSs, subject to the delivery of cash in lieu of fractional Parent Ordinary Shares in accordance with this Section 2.05 and Section 2.09 which sections shall be applied mutatis mutandis with respect to those holders of Company Common Stock that elect to receive Parent Ordinary Shares in lieu of Parent ADSs.\\n\\n \\n\\n26\\n\\n \\n\\nSection 2.06                             Dissenting Shares.  Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, shares of Company Common Stock that are issued and outstanding immediately prior to the First Effective Time and that are held by a stockholder who is entitled to demand, and properly demands, appraisal of such shares pursuant to, and who complies in all respects with, the provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL (such stockholders, the “Dissenting Stockholders” and, such shares of Company Common Stock, the “Dissenting Shares”), shall not be converted into or be exchangeable for the right to receive the Merger Consideration, but instead such holder shall be entitled to payment of the fair value of such Dissenting Shares in accordance with the provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL (and, at the First Effective Time, such Dissenting Shares shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled and shall cease to exist, and such holder shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the fair value of such Dissenting Shares in accordance with the provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL), unless and until such holder shall have failed to perfect or shall have effectively waived, withdrawn or lost rights to appraisal under the DGCL.  If any Dissenting Stockholders shall have failed to perfect or shall have effectively waived, withdrawn or lost such rights, the Dissenting Shares held by such Dissenting Stockholder shall thereupon be deemed to have been converted into, as of the First Effective Time, and shall thereafter represent only the right to receive, the Merger Consideration as provided in Section 2.03(a) (and cash in lieu of any fractional Parent ADSs and any dividends and distributions with respect thereto as contemplated by Section 2.05(f) and Section 2.09), without interest, and immediately following such cancellation shall be automatically cancelled and cease to exist.  The Company shall give Parent prompt notice of any written demands for appraisal of any shares of Company Common Stock, attempted withdrawals of such demands and any other instruments served pursuant to the DGCL and received by the Company relating to stockholders’ rights of appraisal in accordance with the provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL, and Parent the opportunity to participate in all negotiations and proceedings with respect to all such demands.  The Company shall not, except with the prior written consent of Parent, make any payment with respect to, settle or offer or agree to settle any such demands.  Any portion of the Merger Consideration made available to the Exchange Agent pursuant to Section 2.05 to pay for shares of Company Common Stock for which appraisal rights have been perfected shall be returned to Parent (or to Bidco if Parent so directs) on demand.\\n\\n \\n\\nSection 2.07                             Company Equity Awards.\\n\\n \\n\\n(a)                                 Company Stock Options.  At the First Effective Time, each compensatory option to purchase shares of Company Common Stock granted under any Company Stock Plan that is outstanding and unexercised immediately prior to the First Effective Time (each, a “Company Stock Option”), whether or not vested shall, by virtue of the First Merger and without further action on the part of the holder thereof, be cancelled in consideration for the right to receive, within five Business Days following the First Effective Time, the Merger Consideration, without interest and less applicable withholding Taxes, in respect of each Net Option Share subject to such Company Stock Option immediately prior to the First Effective Time.  For purposes of this Agreement, “Net Option Share” means, with respect to a Company Stock Option, the quotient obtained by dividing (i) the product obtained by multiplying (A) the excess, if any, of the value of the Merger Consideration over the exercise price per share of Company Common Stock subject to such Company Stock Option immediately prior to the First Effective Time by (B) the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Company Stock\\n\\n \\n\\n27\\n\\n \\n\\nOption immediately prior to the First Effective Time by (ii) the value of the Merger Consideration.  For purposes of the preceding sentence, the value of the component of the Merger Consideration that consists of Parent ADSs shall equal the product of (x) the Exchange Ratio and (y) the Parent ADS Price.\\n\\n \\n\\n(b)                                 Company Restricted Stock Units.  At the First Effective Time, each restricted stock unit award with respect to shares of Company Common Stock outstanding under any Company Stock Plan that vests solely based on the passage of time (each, a “Company RSU Award”) shall be treated as set forth in this Section 2.07.\\n\\n \\n\\n(i)                                     At the First Effective Time, each Company RSU Award held by a non-employee director shall, by virtue of the First Merger and without further action on the part of the holder thereof, become fully vested and cancelled and converted into the right to receive, within five Business Days following the First Effective Time, the Merger Consideration, without interest and less applicable withholding Taxes, with respect to each share of Company Common Stock subject to such Company RSU Award (or portion thereof) immediately prior to the First Effective Time; provided, that if application of this Section 2.07(b)(i) to any such Company RSU Award (or portion thereof) would result in the imposition of a penalty under Section 409A of the Code, then such Company RSU Award (or portion thereof) shall instead be converted into an Assumed RSU Award in accordance with Section 2.07(b)(ii).\\n\\n \\n\\n(ii)                                  At the First Effective Time, each Company RSU Award (or portion thereof) that is not covered by Section 2.07(b)(i) shall be assumed by Parent and shall be converted into a restricted unit award (each, an “Assumed RSU Award”) that settles in a number of Parent ADSs equal to the number of shares of Company Common Stock underlying the Company RSU Award (or portion thereof) multiplied by the Equity Award Exchange Ratio, rounded up to the nearest whole number of shares.  Each Assumed RSU Award shall continue to have, and shall be subject to, the same terms and conditions as applied to the corresponding Company RSU Award immediately prior to the First Effective Time (including any terms and conditions relating to accelerated vesting on a termination of the holder’s employment in connection with or following the Merger).\\n\\n \\n\\n(c)                                  Company Performance-Based Restricted Stock Units.  At the First Effective Time, each restricted stock unit award with respect to shares of Company Common Stock outstanding under any Company Stock Plan that vests based on the achievement of performance goals (each, a “Company PSU Award”) shall, by virtue of the First Merger and without further action on the part of the holder thereof, be assumed by Parent and converted into a restricted unit award (each, an “Assumed PSU Award”) that settles in a number of Parent ADSs equal to the product of the number of shares of Company Common Stock underlying the Company PSU Award (with such number of shares determined by deeming the applicable performance goals to be achieved at the greater of (i) the target level and (ii) the actual level of achievement through the latest practicable date prior to the First Effective Time as determined by the Leadership and Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of the Company prior to the First Effective Time), subject to a limit of 175% of target for Company PSU Awards granted in 2019 and subject to a limit of 150% of target for Company PSU Awards granted in 2020\\n\\n \\n\\n28\\n\\n \\n\\nmultiplied by the Equity Award Exchange Ratio, rounded up to the nearest whole number of shares.  Each Assumed PSU Award shall continue to have, and shall be subject to, the same terms and conditions as applied to the corresponding Company PSU Award (other than performance-based vesting conditions) immediately prior to the First Effective Time (including any terms and conditions relating to accelerated vesting on a termination of the holder’s employment in connection with or following the Merger).\\n\\n \\n\\n(d)                                 Reservation of Shares.  As soon as practicable following the Closing Date (but in no event more than five Business Days following the Closing Date), Parent shall file a registration statement on Form S-8 (or any successor form) or, if required, Form F-3 (or any successor form), with respect to the issuance of the Parent ADSs subject to the Assumed RSU Awards and the Assumed PSU Awards and shall use reasonable best efforts to maintain the effectiveness of such registration statement or registration statements (and maintain the current status of the prospectus or prospectuses contained therein) for so long as the Assumed RSU Awards and the Assumed PSU Awards remain

Subsidiaries disclaim any other representations or warranties, whether made by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective Affiliates or Representatives.  Each of Parent, Bidco and each Merger Sub acknowledges and agrees that, except for the representations and warranties made by the Company in Article IV (as qualified by the applicable items disclosed in the Company Disclosure

Company Stockholder Approval (the “Company Approval Time”), the Board of Directors of the Company receives a bona fide written Company Acquisition Proposal made after the date of this Agreement that has not resulted from a violation of this Section 6.02, the Board of Directors of the Company, directly or indirectly through its Representatives, may (i) contact the Third Party that has made such Company Acquisition Proposal in order to ascertain facts or clarify terms for the sole purpose of the Board of Directors of the Company informing itself about such Company Acquisition Proposal and such Third Party and (ii) if the Board of Directors of the Company\\n\\n \\n\\n73\\n\\n \\n\\ndetermines in good faith, after consultation with its financial advisor and outside legal counsel, that such Company Acquisition Proposal is or could reasonably be expected to lead to a Company Superior Proposal, (A) subject to compliance with this Section 6.02, engage in negotiations or discussions with such Third Party and (B) furnish to such Third Party and its Representatives and financing sources non-public information relating to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries pursuant to a confidentiality agreement that (1) does not contain any provision that would prevent the Company from complying with its obligation to provide disclosure to Parent pursuant to this Section 6.02 and (2) contains confidentiality and use provisions that, in each case, are no less favorable in the aggregate to the Company than those contained in the Confidentiality Agreement; provided, that all such non-public information (to the extent that such information has not been previously provided or made available to Parent) is provided or made available to Parent, as the case may be, substantially concurrently with the time it is provided or made available to such Third Party.  Nothing contained herein shall prevent the Board of Directors of the Company from (x) taking and disclosing to the stockholders of the Company a position contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a), Rule 14d-9 or Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A promulgated under the 1934 Act, or (y) making any required disclosure to the stockholders of the Company if the Board of Directors of the Company determines in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel, that the failure to take such action would be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with Applicable Law; provided, that any such action or disclosure that constitutes a Company Adverse Recommendation Change shall be made in compliance with the applicable provisions of this Section 6.02.  A “stop, look and listen” disclosure pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) under the 1934 Act in connection with a tender or exchange offer shall not constitute a Company Adverse Recommendation Change.\\n\\n \\n\\n(c)                                  The Company shall notify Parent as promptly as practicable (but in no event later than 24 hours) after receipt by the Company (or any of its Representatives) of any Company Acquisition Proposal or any request for information relating to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries that, to the knowledge of the Company, has been or is reasonably likely to have been made in connection with any Company Acquisition Proposal, which notice shall be provided in writing and shall identify the Third Party making, and the material terms and conditions of, any such Company Acquisition Proposal or request.  The Company shall thereafter (i) keep Parent reasonably informed, on a reasonably current basis, of any material changes in the status and details (or any changes to the type and amount of consideration) of any such Company Acquisition Proposal or request and (ii) as promptly as practicable (but in no event later than 24 hours after receipt) provide to Parent copies of any material written correspondence, proposals or indications of interest relating to the terms and conditions of such Company Acquisition Proposal or request provided to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (as well as written summaries of any material oral communications relating to the terms and conditions of any Company Acquisition Proposal).\\n\\n \\n\\n(d)                                 Anything in this Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding, prior to the Company Approval Time, in response to a Company Acquisition Proposal that the Board of Directors of the Company determines in good faith constitutes a Company Superior Proposal, the Board of Directors of the Company may, subject to compliance with this Section 6.02(d), (i) make a Company Adverse Recommendation Change and/or (ii) terminate this Agreement in accordance with Section 10.01(d)(iii); provided, that (A) the Company shall first notify Parent in writing at least four Business Days before taking such action that the Company intends to take\\n\\n \\n\\n74\\n\\n \\n\\nsuch action, which notice shall include an unredacted copy of such proposal and a copy of any financing commitments (in the form provided to the Company) relating thereto (and, to the extent not in writing, the material terms and conditions thereof and the identity of the person making any such proposal), (B) the Company shall make its Representatives reasonably available to negotiate with Parent and its Representatives during such four Business Day notice period, to the extent Parent wishes to negotiate, to enable Parent to propose revisions to the terms of this Agreement such that it would cause such Company Superior Proposal to no longer constitute a Company Superior Proposal, (C) upon the end of such notice period, the Board of Directors of the Company shall have considered in good faith any revisions to the terms of this Agreement committed to in writing by Parent, and shall have determined that the Company Superior Proposal would nevertheless continue to constitute a Company Superior Proposal if the revisions committed to in writing by Parent were to be given effect and (D) in the event of any change, from time to time, to any of the financial terms or any other material terms of such Company Superior Proposal, the Company shall, in each case, have delivered to Parent an additional notice consistent with that described in clause (A) of this proviso and a new notice period under clause (A) of this proviso shall commence each time, except each such notice period shall be three Business Days (instead of four Business Days), during which time the Company shall be required to comply with the requirements of this Section 6.02(d) anew with respect to each such additional notice, including clauses (A) through (D) above of this proviso.\\n\\n \\n\\n(e)                                  Anything in this Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding, at any time prior to the Company Approval Time, the Board of Directors of the Company may effect a Company Adverse Recommendation Change in response or relating to a Company Intervening Event if the Board of Directors of the Company determines in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel, that the failure to take such action would be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under Applicable Law; provided, that (i) the Company shall first notify Parent in writing at least four Business Days before taking such action of its intention to take such action, which notice shall include a reasonably detailed description of such Company Intervening Event, (ii) if requested by Parent, the Company shall make its Representatives reasonably available to negotiate with Parent and its Representatives during such four Business Day period following such notice regarding any proposal by Parent to amend the terms of this Agreement in response to such Company Intervening Event, and (iii) the Board of Directors of the Company shall not effect any Company Adverse Recommendation Change involving or relating to a Company Intervening Event unless, after the four Business Day period described in the foregoing clause (ii), the Board of Directors of the Company determines in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel and taking into account any written commitment by Parent to amend the terms of this Agreement during such four Business Day period, that the failure to take such action would continue to be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under Applicable Law.\\n\\n \\n\\n(f)                                   The Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, and shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause its and its Subsidiaries’ Representatives to, cease immediately and cause to be terminated any and all existing discussions or negotiations, if any, with any Third Party conducted prior to or ongoing as of the date of this Agreement with respect to any actual or potential (including if such discussions or negotiations were for the purpose of soliciting any) Company Acquisition Proposal or with respect to any indication, proposal or inquiry that could reasonably be expected to lead to a Company Acquisition Proposal and shall use its reasonable\\n\\n \\n\\n75\\n\\n \\n\\nbest efforts to cause any such Third Party (and any of its Representatives) in possession of confidential information about the Company or any of its Subsidiaries that was furnished by or on behalf of the Company in connection with such discussions or negotiations to return or destroy all such information.\\n\\n \\n\\nSection 6.03

customary “comfort letters” to Parent’s Financing Sources in connection with such offering, including as to customary negative assurances required to consummate such offering (it being understood that the Company need only to provide information to assist the Parent in the preparation of pro forma financial information, and shall not in any event be required to provide pro forma financial statements, projections or pro forma adjustments), and (II) furnish Parent and its Financing Sources with such other customary information relating to the Company and its Subsidiaries that is reasonably requested by Parent and is customarily required in marketing materials for Debt Financings of the applicable type.\\n\\n \\n\\n(v)                                 provide to Parent and the Financing Sources promptly all documentation and other information about the Company and its Subsidiaries required by the Financing Sources or regulatory authorities with respect to the Debt Financing under applicable “know your customer” and anti-money laundering rules and regulations, including the PATRIOT Act, that is required under any Debt Financing to the extent such documentation and other information is requested in writing to the Company at least ten Business Days prior to the Closing Date,\\n\\n \\n\\n(vi)                              subject to customary confidentiality provisions and disclaimers, provide customary authorization letters to the Financing Sources authorizing the distribution of information to prospective lenders or investors,\\n\\n \\n\\n(vii)                           facilitate the payoff, discharge and termination in full substantially concurrently with Closing of obligations outstanding under the Credit Agreement (including, without limitation, using commercially reasonable efforts to facilitate the calculation of the amounts required to effect the payoff and termination of the Credit Agreement in full at Closing no less than three Business Days prior thereto); provided that (A) neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries shall have any obligation to make any payment in respect of the foregoing unless and until the Closing occurs and it being understood that at the Closing, Parent and its Subsidiaries shall provide the Company and its Subsidiaries with the funds necessary for the Company to actually effect such payoff and termination and (B) no such action shall be required unless it can be and is conditioned on the occurrence of the Closing, and\\n\\n \\n\\n(viii)                        consent to the reasonable use of trademarks and logos of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries in connection with the Debt Financing; provided, that such trademarks and logos are used solely in a manner that is not intended to or is reasonably likely to harm or disparage the Company or its Subsidiaries or the reputation or goodwill of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries.\\n\\n \\n\\n(b)                                 The foregoing notwithstanding, neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries shall be required to (i) take or permit the taking of any action pursuant to Section 6.03(a) that (A) would require the Company, its Subsidiaries or any Persons who are directors or\\n\\n \\n\\n77\\n\\n \\n\\nofficers of the Company or its Subsidiaries to enter into or approve any definitive financing or purchase agreement for the Debt Financing effective prior to the Closing, pass resolutions or consents to approve or authorize the execution of the Debt Financing, execute or deliver any certificate, document, instrument or agreement or agree to any change or modification of any existing certificate, document, instrument or agreement, in each case, that is effective prior to the Closing, or that would be effective if the Closing does not occur (other than customary authorization letters to the Financing Sources authorizing the distribution of information to prospective lenders or investors); (B) would cause any representation or warranty in this Agreement to be breached by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (unless waived by Parent); (C) would require the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to pay any commitment or other similar fee prior to the Closing or incur any other expense, liability or obligation in connection with the Debt Financing prior to the Closing; (D) could reasonably be expected to cause any director, officer or employee or stockholder of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to incur any personal liability in their capacity as such; (E) conflict with the organizational documents of the Company or its Subsidiaries or any Applicable Law; or (F) could reasonably be expected to result in a material violation or breach of, or a default (with or without notice, lapse of time, or both) under, any Contract to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party; (ii) provide access to or disclose information that the Company or any of its Subsidiaries reasonably determines would jeopardize any attorney-client privilege of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries; (iii) prepare (A) any IFRS financial statements or reconciliations or otherwise provide financial information in a format other than in accordance with GAAP or (B) any other financial statements or information that are not reasonably available to it or that are not capable of being prepared by it without undue burden or otherwise with the use of commercially reasonable efforts; (iv) enter into any instrument or agreement with respect to the Debt Financing that is effective prior to the occurrence of the Closing or that would be effective if the Closing does not occur; or (v)  prepare any projections or pro forma financial statements; or (vi) deliver or cause to be delivered any opinion of counsel in connection with the Debt Financing.  Nothing contained in this Section 6.03 or otherwise shall require the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, prior to the Closing, to be an issuer or other obligor with respect to the Debt Financing.\\n\\n \\n\\n(c)                                  Parent and Merger Subs shall, on a joint and several basis, promptly on written request by the Company, reimburse the Company for all reasonable and documented out-of-pocket costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys’ fees) incurred by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries in connection with the Debt Financing or satisfying its obligations under this Section 6.03, whether or not the Mergers are consummated or this Agreement is terminated (excluding, for the avoidance of doubt, the costs of the preparation of any annual or quarterly financial statements of the Company to the extent prepared in the ordinary course of its financial reporting practice).  Parent and Merger Subs shall, on a joint and several basis, indemnify and hold harmless the Company and its Subsidiaries and their respective Representatives from and against any and all losses, claims, damages, liabilities, reasonable out-of-pocket costs, reasonable out-of-pocket attorneys’ fees, judgments, fines, penalties and amounts paid in settlement (including all interest, assessments and other charges paid or payable in connection with or in respect of any thereof) suffered or incurred in connection with the Debt Financing or otherwise in connection with any action taken by the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective Representatives pursuant to this Section 6.03 (other than the use of any information provided by the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective Representatives in writing for use in connection with the Debt Financing) whether or not the Mergers are\\n\\n \\n\\n78\\n\\n \\n\\nconsummated or this Agreement is terminated, except in the event such losses, claims, damages, liabilities, reasonable out-of-pocket costs reasonable out-of-pocket attorneys’ fees, judgments, fines, penalties and amounts paid in settlement (including all interest, assessments and other charges paid or payable in connection with or in respect of any thereof) arise out of or result from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of the Company or its Subsidiaries in fulfilling their obligations pursuant to this Section 6.03.\\n\\n \\n\\n(d)                                 Anything to the contrary in this Agreement notwithstanding,(i) the parties hereto acknowledge and agree that the provisions contained in this Section 6.03 represent the sole obligation of the Company, its Subsidiaries and their respective Representatives with respect to cooperation in connection with the arrangement of any financing (including the Debt Financing) to be obtained by Parent, Bidco or either Merger Sub with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and no other provision of this Agreement (including the Exhibits and Schedules hereto) shall be deemed to expand or modify such obligations; (ii) the Company’s breach of any of the covenants required to be performed by it under this Section 6.03 shall not be considered in determining the satisfaction of the condition set forth in Section 9.02(a) unless such breach is the primary cause of, or primarily resulted in, Parent being unable to consummate the Mergers; and (iii) the receipt and availability of any funds or financing is not a condition to Closing under this Agreement nor is it a condition to Closing under this Agreement for Parent to obtain all or any portion of the Debt Financing or any other financing.\\n\\n \\n\\n(e)                                  All confidential information provided by Company, its Subsidiaries and their respective Representatives shall be kept confidential in accordance with the Confidentiality Agreement, except that Parent shall be permitted to disclose such information as applicable to any number of Financing Sources as would be reasonable and customary in connection with any financing; provided, that all confidential information shared with Financing Sources shall be kept confidential and otherwise treated in accordance with the Confidentiality Agreement or other confidentiality obligations that are substantially similar to those contained in the Confidentiality Agreement (which, with respect to the Financing Sources, may be satisfied by the confidentiality provisions applicable thereto under the Bridge Facility Agreement or other customary confidentiality undertakings in the context of customary syndication practices from Financing Sources not party to the Bridge Facility Agreement).\\n\\n \\n\\nARTICLE VII\\n\\n \\n\\nCOVENANTS OF PARENT, BIDCO AND MERGER SUBS\\n\\n \\n\\nSection 7.01                             Conduct of Parent.\\n\\n \\n\\n(a)                                 From the date of this Agreement until the earlier of the First Effective Time and the termination of this Agreement, except (x) as prohibited or required by Applicable Law, (y) as set forth in Section 7.01 of the Parent Disclosure Schedule, or (z) as otherwise required or expressly contemplated by this Agreement, unless the Company shall have given its prior written consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), Parent shall, and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to, use commercially reasonable efforts to conduct its business in all material respects in the ordinary course of business; provided, that (i) no action by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries to the extent expressly permitted\\n\\n \\n\\n79\\n\\n \\n\\nby an exception to any of Section 7.01(b)(i) through Section 7.01(b)(vi) shall be a breach of this sentence and (ii) Parent’s or any of its Subsidiaries’ failure to take any action prohibited by any of Section 7.01(b)(i) through Section 7.01(b)(vi) shall not be deemed to be a breach of this Section 7.01(a).\\n\\n \\n\\n(b)                                 From the date of this Agreement until the earlier of the First Effective Time and the termination of this Agreement, except (x) as prohibited or required by Applicable Law, (y) as set forth in Section 7.01 of the Parent Disclosure Schedule, or (z) as otherwise required or expressly contemplated by this Agreement, without the Company’s prior written consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), Parent shall not, and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries not to:\\n\\n \\n\\n(i)                                     adopt or propose any change (A) to the Parent Organizational Documents that would adversely impact the rights of the holders of the Parent Ordinary Shares or the holders of the Parent ADSs, or (B) the organizational documents of Bidco or either Merger Sub;\\n\\n \\n\\n(ii)                                  (A) split, combine or reclassify any shares of Parent, (B) declare, set aside or pay any dividend or make any other distribution (whether in cash, stock, property or any combination thereof) in respect of any shares of Parent, other than regular cash dividends in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice (including with respect to the timing of declaration, and the record and payment dates) in an amount not to exceed $1.60 per Parent ADS in any 12-month period (appropriately adjusted to reflect any stock dividends, subdivisions, splits, combinations or other similar events relating to the Parent ADSs), or (C) redeem, repurchase, cancel or otherwise acquire or offer to redeem, repurchase, or otherwise acquire any of the Equity Securities of Parent, other than repurchases of Parent Ordinary Shares or Parent ADSs (whether directly by Parent or by a third party employee benefit trust funded by Parent) in connection with the exercise, vesting or settlement of Parent Equity Awards (including in satisfaction of any amounts required to be deducted or withheld under Applicable Law), in each case outstanding as of the date of this Agreement in accordance with the present terms of such Parent Equity Awards or granted after the date of this Agreement to the extent permitted by this Agreement;\\n\\n \\n\\n(iii)                               issue, deliver or sell, or authorize the issuance, delivery or sale of any shares of Parent, other than (A) the issuance of any shares of Parent Ordinary Shares or Parent ADSs on the exercise, vesting or settlement of Parent Equity Awards, (B) the grant of Parent Equity Awards to employees, directors or individual independent contractors of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries pursuant to Parent’s equity compensation plans or (C) in connection with the Parent ADS Issuance;\\n\\n \\n\\n(iv)                              (A) sell substantially all of the consolidated assets of Parent, (B) adopt a plan of complete or partial liquidation or dissolution or (C) enter into a business combination transaction that provides for the pre-transaction Parent Ordinary Shares as of the closing such transaction, to no longer represent at least a

as a result of the transaction, of the publicly traded company;\\n\\n \\n\\n(v)                                 take any action or knowingly fail to take any action where such action or failure to act could reasonably be expected to (A) prevent or impede the Mergers, taken together, from qualifying as a “reorganization” within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code or (B) cause the stockholders of the Company (other than any Excepted Stockholder) to recognize gain pursuant to Section 367(a)(1) of the Code; or\\n\\n \\n\\n(vi)                              agree, resolve, commit or propose to do any of the foregoing.\\n\\n \\n\\n(c)                                  Anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement notwithstanding, Parent shall not, and shall cause its Affiliates not to, directly or indirectly (whether by merger, consolidation or otherwise), acquire, purchase, lease or license or otherwise enter into a transaction with (or agree to acquire, purchase, lease or license or otherwise enter into a transaction with) any business, corporation, partnership, association or other business organization or division or part thereof that has one or more products, whether marketed or in development, that compete, or if commercialized would compete, with one or more Company Products, if doing so would reasonably be expected to (i) impose any material delay in the satisfaction of, or increase materially the risk of not satisfying the conditions set forth in Section 9.01(c) (to the extent related to any Antitrust Law) or the conditions set forth in Section 9.01(h); (ii) materially increase the risk of any Governmental Authority entering an Order prohibiting or enjoining the consummation of the Mergers; or (iii) otherwise prevent or materially delay the consummation of the Mergers (including the Debt Financing).  The fact that a merger, acquisition or similar transaction requires approval under the Antitrust Laws shall not in and of itself restrict such transaction under this Section 7.01(c).\\n\\n \\n\\nSection 7.02                             No Solicitation by Parent.\\n\\n \\n\\n(a)                                 From the date of this Agreement until the earlier of the First Effective Time and the termination of this Agreement, except as otherwise set forth in this Section 7.02, Parent shall not, and shall cause its Subsidiaries and its and its Subsidiaries’ respective directors and officers to not, and shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause its and its Subsidiaries’ other respective Representatives to not, directly or indirectly, (i) solicit, initiate, knowingly facilitate or knowingly encourage (including by way of furnishing information) any inquiries regarding, or the making or submission of any Parent Acquisition Proposal, (ii) (A) enter into or participate in any discussions or negotiations regarding, (B) furnish to any Third Party any information, or (C) otherwise assist, participate in, knowingly facilitate or knowingly encourage any Third Party, in each case, in connection with or for the purpose of knowingly encouraging or facilitating, a Parent Acquisition Proposal, (iii) approve, recommend or enter into, or publicly or formally propose to approve, recommend or enter into, any letter of intent or similar document, agreement, commitment, or agreement in principle (whether written or oral, binding or nonbinding) with respect to a Parent Acquisition Proposal, (iv) (A) withdraw or qualify, amend or modify in any manner adverse to the Company the Parent Board Recommendation, (B) fail to include the Parent Board Recommendation in the Parent Circular or (C) recommend, adopt or approve or publicly propose to recommend, adopt or approve any Parent Acquisition

“fair price”, “supermajority”, “affiliate transactions” or “business combination statute or regulation” or other similar anti-takeover laws and regulations of the State of Delaware, including Section 203 of the DGCL, inapplicable to any Third Party or any Parent Acquisition Proposal.\\n\\n \\n\\n(b)                                 The foregoing notwithstanding, if at any time prior to the receipt of the Parent Shareholder Approval (the “Parent Approval Time”), the Board of Directors of Parent receives a bona fide written Parent Acquisition Proposal made after the date of this Agreement that has not resulted from a violation of this Section 7.02, the Board of Directors of Parent, directly or indirectly through its Representatives, may (i) contact the Third Party that has made such Parent Acquisition Proposal in order to ascertain facts or clarify terms for the sole purpose of the Board of Directors of Parent informing itself about such Parent Acquisition Proposal and such Third Party and (ii) if the Board of Directors of Parent determines in good faith, after consultation with its financial advisor and outside legal counsel, that such Parent Acquisition Proposal is or could reasonably be expected to lead to a Parent Superior Proposal, (A) subject to compliance with this Section 7.02, engage in negotiations or discussions with such Third Party and (B) furnish to such Third Party and its Representatives and financing sources non-public information relating to Parent or any of its Subsidiaries pursuant to a confidentiality agreement that (1) does not contain any provision that would prevent Parent from complying with its obligation to provide disclosure to the Company pursuant to this Section 7.02 and (2) contains confidentiality and use provisions that, in each case, are no less favorable in the aggregate to Parent than those contained in the Confidentiality Agreement; provided, that all such non-public information (to the extent that such information has not been previously provided or made available to the Company) is provided or made available to the Company, as the case may be, substantially concurrently with the time it is provided or made available to such Third Party.  Nothing contained herein shall prevent the Board of Directors of Parent from (x) complying with either Rule 14e-2(a) under the 1934 Act or the U.K. Code, in each case, with regard to a Parent Acquisition Proposal, or (y) making any required disclosure to the shareholders of Parent, either if required by the UK Panel on Takeovers and Mergers, or otherwise if the Board of Directors of Parent determines in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel, that the failure to take such action would be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with Applicable Law; provided, that any such action or disclosure that constitutes a Parent Adverse Recommendation Change shall be made in compliance with the applicable provisions of this Section 7.02.  A “stop, look and listen” disclosure pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) under the 1934 Act in connection with a tender or exchange offer shall not constitute a Parent Adverse Recommendation Change.\\n\\n \\n\\n(c)                                  Parent shall notify the Company as promptly as practicable (but in no event later than 24 hours) after receipt by Parent (or any of its Representatives) of any Parent Acquisition Proposal or any request for information relating to Parent or any of its Subsidiaries that, to the knowledge of Parent, has been or is reasonably likely to have been made in connection with any Parent Acquisition Proposal, which notice shall be provided in writing and shall identify the Third Party making, and the material terms and conditions of, any such Parent Acquisition Proposal or request.  Parent shall thereafter (i) keep the Company reasonably informed, on a reasonably current basis, of any material changes in the status and details (or any changes to the type and amount of consideration) of any such Parent Acquisition Proposal or request and (ii) as promptly as practicable (but in no event later than 24 hours after receipt) provide to the Company copies of any material written correspondence, proposals or indications\\n\\n \\n\\n82\\n\\n \\n\\nof interest relating to the terms and conditions of such Parent Acquisition Proposal or request provided to Parent or any of its Subsidiaries (as well as written summaries of any material oral communications relating to the terms and conditions of any Parent Acquisition Proposal).\\n\\n \\n\\n(d)                                 Anything in this Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding, prior to the Parent Approval Time, in response to a Parent Acquisition Proposal that the Board of Directors of Parent determines in good faith constitutes a Parent Superior Proposal, the Board of Directors of Parent may, subject to compliance with this Section 7.02, make a Parent Adverse Recommendation Change; provided, that (A) Parent shall first notify the Company in writing at least four Business Days before taking such action that Parent intends to take such action, which notice shall include an unredacted copy of such proposal and a copy of any financing commitments (in the form provided to Parent) relating thereto (and, to the extent not in writing, the material terms and conditions thereof and the identity of the person making any such proposal), (B) Parent shall make its Representatives reasonably available to negotiate with the Company and its Representatives during such four Business Day notice period, to the extent the Company wishes to negotiate, to enable the Company to propose revisions to the terms of this Agreement such that it would cause such Parent Superior Proposal to no longer constitute a Parent Superior Proposal, (C) upon the end of such notice period, the Board of Directors of Parent shall have considered in good faith any revisions to the terms of this Agreement committed to in writing by the Company, and shall have determined that the Parent Superior Proposal would nevertheless continue to constitute a Parent Superior Proposal if the revisions committed to in writing by the Company were to be given effect and (D) in the event of any change, from time to time, to any of the financial terms or any other material terms of such Parent Superior Proposal, Parent shall, in each case, have delivered to the Company an additional notice consistent with that described in clause (A) of this proviso and a new notice period under clause (A) of this proviso shall commence each time, except each such notice period shall be three Business Days (instead of four Business Days), during which time Parent shall be required to comply with the requirements of this Section 7.02(d) anew with respect to each such additional notice, including clauses (A) through (D) above of this proviso.\\n\\n \\n\\n(e)                                  Anything in this Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding, at any time prior to the Parent Approval Time, the Board of Directors of Parent may effect a Parent Adverse Recommendation Change in response or relating to a Parent Intervening Event if the Board of Directors of Parent determines in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel, that the failure to take such action would be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under Applicable Law; provided, that (i) Parent shall first notify the Company in writing at least four Business Days before taking such action of its intention to take such action, which notice shall include a reasonably detailed description of such Parent Intervening Event, (ii) if requested by the Company, Parent shall make its Representatives reasonably available to negotiate with the Company and its Representatives during such four Business Day period following such notice regarding any proposal by the Company to amend the terms of this Agreement in response to such Parent Intervening Event, and (iii) the Board of Directors of Parent shall not effect any Parent Adverse Recommendation Change involving or relating to a Parent Intervening Event unless, after the four Business Day period described in the foregoing clause (ii), the Board of Directors of Parent determines in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel and taking into account any written commitment by the Company to amend the terms of this Agreement during such four Business Day period, that the failure to take such\\n\\n \\n\\n83\\n\\n \\n\\naction would continue to be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under Applicable Law.\\n\\n \\n\\n(f)                                   Parent shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, and shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause its and its Subsidiaries’ Representatives to, cease immediately and cause to be terminated any and all existing discussions or negotiations, if any, with any Third Party conducted prior to or ongoing as of the date of this Agreement with respect to any actual or potential (including if such discussions or negotiations were for the purpose of soliciting any) Parent Acquisition Proposal or with respect to any indication, proposal or inquiry that could reasonably be expected to lead to a Parent Acquisition Proposal and shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause any such Third Party (and any of its Representatives) in possession of confidential information about Parent or any of its Subsidiaries that was furnished by or on behalf of Parent in connection with such discussions or negotiations to return or destroy all such information.\\n\\n \\n\\nSection 7.03                             Obligations of Merger Subs.  (a) Until the First Effective Time, Bidco shall at all times be the direct owner of all of the outstanding shares of capital stock of Merger Sub I and Merger Sub II.  Parent shall take all action necessary to cause Bidco and each Merger Sub to perform its obligations under this Agreement and to consummate the Mergers on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement.  Promptly following the execution of this Agreement, Parent, in its capacity as the sole or majority stockholder of Bidco, and Bidco, in its capacity as the sole stockholder of Merger Sub I and sole member of Merger Sub II, shall each execute and deliver a written consent approving and adopting this Agreement in accordance with the DGCL and DLLCA, as applicable.\\n\\n \\n\\nSection 7.04                             Director and Officer Liability.\\n\\n \\n\\n(a)                                 For a period of not less than six years from the First Effective Time, Parent shall cause the First Surviving Corporation and the Surviving Company or any applicable Subsidiary thereof (collectively, the “D&O Indemnifying Parties”), to the fullest extent each such D&O Indemnifying Party is authorized or permitted by Applicable Law, to: (i) indemnify and hold harmless each person who is at the date of this Agreement, was previously, or during the period from the date of this Agreement through the date of the First Effective Time will be, serving as a director or officer of the Company (in the case of indemnification by the First Surviving Corporation and the Surviving Company) or any of its Subsidiaries (in the case of indemnification by such applicable Subsidiary) or, at the request or for the benefit of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, as the case may be, as a director, trustee or officer of any other entity or any benefit plan maintained by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, as the case may be (collectively, the “D&O Indemnified Parties”), as now or hereafter in effect, in connection with any D&O Claim and any losses, claims, damages, liabilities, Claim Expenses, judgments, fines, penalties and amounts paid in settlement (including all interest, assessments and other charges paid or payable in connection with or in respect of any thereof) relating to or resulting from such D&O Claim; and (ii) promptly advance to such D&O Indemnified Party any Claim Expenses incurred in defending, serving as a witness with respect to or otherwise participating with respect to any D&O Claim in advance of the final disposition of such D&O Claim, including payment on behalf of or advancement to the D&O Indemnified Party of any Claim Expenses incurred by such D&O Indemnified Party in connection with enforcing any\\n\\n \\n\\n84\\n\\n \\n\\nrights with respect to such indemnification and/or advancement, in each case without the requirement of any bond or other security, but subject to the D&O Indemnifying Party’s receipt of a written undertaking by or on behalf of such D&O Indemnified Party to repay such Claim Expenses if it is ultimately determined under Applicable Law that such D&O Indemnified Party is not entitled to be indemnified.  All rights to indemnification and advancement conferred hereunder shall continue as to a Person who has ceased to be a director or officer of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries after the date of this Agreement and shall inure to the benefit of such Person’s heirs, successors, executors and personal and legal representatives.  As used in this Section 7.04: (x) the term “D&O Claim” means any threatened, asserted, pending or completed claim, action, suit, proceeding, inquiry or investigation, whether instituted by any party hereto, any Governmental Authority or any other Person, whether civil, criminal, administrative, investigative or other, including any arbitration or other alternative dispute resolution mechanism, arising out of or pertaining to matters that relate to such D&O Indemnified Party’s duties or service (A) as a director, officer or employee of the Company or the applicable Subsidiary thereof at or prior to the First Effective Time (including with respect to any acts, facts, events or omissions occurring in connection with the approval of this Agreement, the Mergers or the consummation of the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including the consideration and approval thereof and the process undertaken in connection therewith and any D&O Claim relating thereto) or (B) as a director, trustee, officer or employee of any other entity or any benefit plan maintained by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (for which such D&O Indemnified Party is or was serving at the request or for the benefit of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries) at or prior to the First Effective Time; and (y) the term “Claim Expenses” means reasonable out-of-pocket attorneys’ fees and all other reasonable out-of-pocket costs, expenses and obligations (including experts’ fees, travel expenses, court costs, retainers, transcript fees, legal research, duplicating, printing and binding costs, as well as telecommunications, postage and courier charges) paid or incurred in connection with investigating, defending, being a witness in or participating in (including on appeal), or preparing to investigate, defend, be a witness in or participate in (including on appeal) any D&O Claim for which indemnification is authorized pursuant to this Section 7.04(a), including any action relating to a claim for indemnification or advancement brought by a D&O Indemnified Party.  No D&O Indemnifying Party shall settle, compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment in any actual or threatened D&O Claim in respect of which indemnification has been sought by such D&O Indemnified Party hereunder unless such settlement, compromise or judgment includes an unconditional release of such D&O Indemnified Party from all liability arising out of such D&O Claim, or such D&O Indemnified Party consents thereto.  Parent shall guarantee the foregoing obligations of the D&O Indemnifying Parties.\\n\\n \\n\\n(b)                                 Without limiting the foregoing, Parent agrees that all rights to indemnification, advancement of expenses and exculpation from liabilities for acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the First Effective Time now existing in favor of the current or former directors, officers or employees of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries as provided in the Company Organizational Documents, similar organizational documents of the Company’s Subsidiaries and indemnification agreements of the Company and its Subsidiaries shall survive the Mergers and shall continue in full force and effect in accordance with their terms.  For a period of not less than six years from the First Effective Time, Parent shall cause the organizational documents of the Surviving Company and its Subsidiaries to contain provisions no less favorable with respect to indemnification, advancement of expenses and limitations on\\n\\n \\n\\n85\\n\\n \\n\\nliability of directors and officers than are set forth in the Company Organizational Documents, which provisions shall not be amended, repealed or otherwise modified for a period of at least six years from the First Effective Time in any manner that would affect adversely the rights thereunder of any individuals who, at or prior to the First Effective Time, were directors, officers or employees of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries.  The Company may purchase (and pay in full the aggregate premium for) a six-year prepaid “tail” insurance policy (which policy by its express terms shall survive the Mergers) of at least the same coverage and amounts and containing terms and conditions that are no less favorable to the covered individuals as the Company’s and its Subsidiaries’ existing directors’ and officers’ insurance policy or policies with a claims period of six years from the First Effective Time for D&O Claims arising from facts, acts, events or omissions that occurred on or prior to the First Effective Time; provided, that the premium for such tail policy shall not exceed three hundred percent of the aggregate annual amounts currently paid by the Company and its Subsidiaries for such insurance (such amount being the “Maximum Premium”).  If the Company fails to obtain such tail policy prior to the First Effective Time, Parent or the Surviving Company shall obtain such a tail policy; provided, that the premium for such tail policy shall not exceed the Maximum Premium; provided, further, that if such tail policy cannot be obtained or can be obtained only by paying aggregate annual premiums in excess of the Maximum Premium, Parent, the Company or the Surviving Company shall only be required to obtain as much coverage as can be obtained by paying an annual premium equal to the Maximum Premium.  Parent and the Surviving Company shall cause any such policy (whether obtained by Parent, the Company or the Surviving Company) to be maintained in full force and effect, for its full term, and Parent shall cause the Surviving Company to honor all its obligations thereunder.\\n\\n \\n\\n(c)                                  If any of Parent or the Surviving Company or any of their respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges with or into any other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving company, partnership or other Person of such consolidation or merger or (ii) liquidates, dissolves or winds-up, or transfers or conveys all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each such case, proper provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of Parent or the Surviving Company, as applicable, assume the obligations set forth in this Section 7.04.\\n\\n \\n\\nSection 7.05                             Employee Matters.\\n\\n \\n\\n(a)                                 From the Closing Date through the date that is 12 months following the Closing Date (the “Benefits Continuation Period”), the Surviving Company shall provide, and Parent shall cause the Surviving Company to provide, to each individual who is employed by the Company and its Subsidiaries immediately prior to the First Effective Time, while such individual continues to be employed by the Surviving Company, Parent or any of Parent’s Subsidiaries (including Subsidiaries of the Surviving Company) during the Benefits Continuation Period (collectively, the “Affected Employees”) (i) a base salary or wage rate that is not less than the base salary or wage rate provided to such Affected Employee immediately prior to the First Effective Time, (ii) cash and equity incentive compensation opportunities that are in the aggregate no less favorable than the aggregate cash and equity incentive compensation opportunities provided to such Affected Employee immediately prior to the First Effective Time, and (iii) employee benefits that are substantially comparable in the aggregate to the employee benefits provided to such Affected Employee under the Company Employee Plans immediately\\n\\n \\n\\n86\\n\\n \\n\\nprior to the First Effective Time; provided, however, that no retention, change-in control or other special or non-recurring compensation or benefits provided prior to the First Effective Time shall be taken into account for purposes of this covenant.\\n\\n \\n\\n(b)                                 With respect to any employee benefit plan in which any Affected Employee first becomes eligible to participate on or after the First Effective Time (the “New Company Plans”), Parent shall: (i) use commercially reasonable efforts to waive all pre-existing conditions, exclusions and waiting periods with respect to participation and coverage requirements applicable to such Affected Employee under any New Company Plan that is a health or welfare plan in which such Affected Employee may be eligible to participate after the First Effective Time to the extent satisfied or waived under a comparable Company Employee Plan, (ii) recognize service of Affected Employees (to the extent credited by the Company or its Subsidiaries in any comparable Company Employee Plan) accrued prior to the First Effective Time for all purposes under (but not for the purposes of benefit accrual under any defined benefit pension plan) any New Company Plan in which such Affected Employees may be eligible to participate after the First Effective Time, provided, however, that in no event shall any credit be given to the extent it would result in the duplication of benefits for the same period of service, and (iii) if applicable, use commercially reasonable efforts to cause to be credited, in any New Company Plan that is a health plan in which Affected Employees participate, any deductibles or out-of-pocket expenses incurred by such Affected Employee and such Affected Employee’s beneficiaries and dependents during the portion of the calendar year in which such Affected Employee first becomes eligible for the New Company Plan that occurs prior to such Affected Employee’s commencement of participation in such New Company Plan with the objective that there be no double counting during the first year of eligibility of such deductibles or out-of-pocket expenses.\\n\\n \\n\\n(c)                                  The Company may provide to each employee who, immediately prior to the First Effective Time, is employed by the Company or a Subsidiary thereof and is eligible to participate in an annual bonus program of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries a pro-rated portion of the annual bonus with respect to the portion of the year of the Closing that occurs prior to the Closing, which bonus shall be determined based on actual performance through the latest practicable date prior to the Closing Date, as determined by the Company prior to the First Effective Time.\\n\\n \\n\\n(d)                                 Nothing contained in this Section 7.05 or elsewhere in this Agreement, express or implied (i) shall cause either Parent or any of its Affiliates to be obligated to continue to employ any Person, including any Affected Employees, for any period of time following the First Effective Time, (ii) shall prevent Parent or its Affiliates from revising, amending or terminating any Company Employee Plan, Parent Employee Plan or any other employee benefit plan, program or policy in effect from time to time, (iii) shall be construed as an amendment of any Company Employee Plan, Parent Employee Plan or any other employee benefit plan, program or policy in effect from time to time, or (iv) shall create any third-party beneficiary rights in any director, officer, employee or individual Person, including any present or former employee, officer, director or individual independent contractor of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (including any beneficiary or dependent of such individual).\\n\\n \\n\\n87\\n\\n \\n\\nSection 7.06                             Financing.\\n\\n \\n\\n(a)                                 Each of Parent, Bidco and each Merger Sub shall use reasonable best efforts, and shall cause their respective Subsidiaries to use reasonable best efforts, to take or shall cause to be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable to maintain the commitments under and to consummate the Debt Financing and obtain the proceeds thereof (including for the avoidance of doubt, the Bridge Facility Agreement or any replacement financing (provided, that (i) the conditions to the availability of any such replacement financing shall not be materially less favorable to Parent than those of the Bridge Facility Agreement and (ii) the other terms of such replacement financing shall not be materially less favorable to Parent than those of the Bridge Facility Agreement in any manner that materially adversely affects the ability or likelihood of Parent, Bidco or either Merger Sub from timely consummating the transactions contemplated by this Agreement)) in an amount sufficient, together with other funds available to the Parent and its Subsidiaries, to enable Parent or Bidco to pay in cash the Required Financing Amount at the Closing.\\n\\n \\n\\n(b)                                 (i) From time to time, upon the written request of the Company, Parent shall inform the Company in reasonable detail on the status of its efforts to arrange the Debt Financing and (ii) Parent shall give the Company prompt written notice of (A) any termination of the Bridge Facility Agreement (other than any termination in connection with a replacement financing thereof), (B) the receipt of any notice or other communication from any Financing Source with respect to such Financing Source’s failure or anticipated failure to fund its commitments under any definitive agreements relating to the Debt Financing (other than in connection with a replacement lender assuming the commitments of a defaulting lender pursuant to the documentation related to the applicable Debt Financing), (C) any material default or material breach by any party to the Debt Financing of which Parent, Bidco or either Merger Sub has become aware (other than in connection with a replacement lender assuming the commitments of a defaulting lender pursuant to the documentation related to the applicable Debt Financing) and (D) any condition precedent of the Debt Financing as to which Parent, Bidco or either Merger Sub believes will not be satisfied at Closing.\\n\\n \\n\\n(c)                                  Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, Parent, Bidco, and each Merger Sub acknowledge and agree that the receipt and availability of any funds or financing is not a condition to Closing under this Agreement nor is it a condition to Closing under this Agreement for Parent to obtain all or any portion of the Debt Financing or any other financing.\\n\\n \\n\\nSection 7.07                             CVR Agreement.  From and after the First Effective Time, Parent shall expressly assume in writing all of the First Surviving Corporation’s obligations, duties and covenants under the CVR Agreement.\\n\\n \\n\\n88\\n\\n \\n\\nARTICLE VIII\\n\\n \\n\\nCOVENANTS OF PARENT, MERGER SUBS AND THE COMPANY\\n\\n \\n\\nSection 8.01                             Access to Information; Confidentiality.\\n\\n \\n\\n(a)                                 All information furnished pursuant to this Agreement shall be subject to the Amended and Restated Confidentiality Agreement, dated as of October 4, 2020 (as amended, supplemented or otherwise modified from time to time in accordance with its

any of its Subsidiaries.  During such period described in the immediately preceding sentence, on reasonable notice and subject to Applicable Law and during normal business hours, the Company shall instruct its pertinent Representatives to reasonably cooperate with Parent in its review of any such information provided or made available pursuant to the immediately preceding sentence.  No information or knowledge obtained in any review or investigation pursuant to this Section 8.01 shall affect or be deemed to modify any representation or warranty made by the Company or Parent pursuant to this Agreement.\\n\\n \\n\\n(b)                                 To the extent reasonably necessary for the Company to confirm the accuracy of the representations of Parent, Bidco and each Merger Sub set forth in Article V and the satisfaction of the conditions precedent set forth in Section 9.03(a) and Section 9.03(b), Parent shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, afford to the Company

any of its Subsidiaries.\\n\\n \\n\\n(c)                                  Anything to the contrary in this Section 8.01, Section 8.02 or Section 8.03 notwithstanding, none of the Company, Parent, nor any of their respective Subsidiaries shall be required to provide access to, disclose information to or assist or cooperate with the other party, in each case if such access, disclosure, assistance or cooperation (i) would, as reasonably determined based on the advice of outside counsel, jeopardize any attorney-client, attorney-work product or other similar privilege with respect to such

in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or any other sale process, (iv) would result in the disclosure of any information in connection with any litigation or similar dispute between the parties hereto or\\n\\n \\n\\n89\\n\\n \\n\\n(v) would result in the disclosure of any trade secrets; provided, that the Company and Parent shall, and each shall cause its Subsidiaries to, use reasonable best efforts to make appropriate substitute disclosure arrangements under circumstances in which such restrictions apply (including redacting such information (A) to

provided in Section 10.03; provided, that, subject to Section 10.03(g), neither Parent nor the Company shall be released from any liabilities or damages arising out of any (i) fraud by any party or (ii) the Willful Breach of any covenant or agreement set forth in this Agreement.  The provisions of Section 6.03(c), the first sentence of Section 8.01(a), this Section 10.02, Section 10.03, Article XI (other than Section 11.13, except to the extent that Section 11.13 relates to the specific performance of the provisions of this Agreement that survive termination) and Section 1.01 (to the extent

compensation, a payment in an amount equal to $1,180,000,000 (the “Company Termination Payment”) at or prior to, and as a condition to the effectiveness of, the termination of this Agreement in the case of a termination pursuant to Section 10.01(d)(iii) or as promptly as practicable (and, in any event, within two Business Days following such termination) in the case of a termination pursuant to Section 10.01(c)(i).\\n\\n \\n\\n(b)                                 If (i) this Agreement is terminated by Parent or Company pursuant to Section 10.01(b)(iii), (ii) prior to such termination and after the date of this Agreement, a Company Acquisition Proposal shall have been publicly announced or publicly made known and shall not have been publicly withdrawn at least four Business Days prior to the Company Stockholder Meeting and (iii) on or prior to the twelve-month anniversary of such termination of this Agreement: (A) a transaction constituting a Company Acquisition Proposal is consummated; or (B) a definitive agreement relating to a Company Acquisition Proposal is entered into by the Company or any of its Affiliates (in each case, whether or not such Company Acquisition Proposal is the same as the original Company Acquisition Proposal publicly made known or publicly announced), then, the Company shall pay to Parent (or its designee) by way of compensation the Company Termination Payment no later than the consummation of such Company Acquisition Proposal; provided, that if the Company shall have actually paid the Company No Vote Payment pursuant to Section 10.03(e), then only the incremental amount between the Company No Vote Payment and the Company Termination Payment shall be payable.  “Company Acquisition Proposal” for purposes of this Section 10.03(b) shall have the meaning assigned thereto in the definition thereof set forth in Section 1.01, except that references in the definition to “20%” shall be replaced by “50%”.\\n\\n \\n\\n(c)                                  If this Agreement is terminated by the Company pursuant to Section 10.01(d)(i), Parent shall pay to the Company (or its designee), in cash and by way of compensation within three Business Days after the date of termination of this Agreement (or such other later date as the Company has notified in writing to Parent on the date of termination), a payment in an amount equal to $1,415,000,000 (the “Parent Termination Payment”), subject to any adjustment in accordance with Section 10.03(i).\\n\\n \\n\\n(d)                                 If this Agreement is terminated by the Company or Parent pursuant to Section 10.01(b)(iv), Parent shall pay to the Company (or its designee), in cash and by way of compensation within three Business Days after the date of termination of this Agreement (or such other later date as the Company has notified in writing to Parent on the date of termination), a payment in an amount equal to the Parent Termination Payment; provided, that such amount shall be payable only if either (i) the Company Stockholder Approval shall have previously been obtained or (ii) (A) the condition to termination under Section 10.01(b)(iii) has not been satisfied at the time of such termination, (B) the Company has complied with Section 8.04(c) and (C) more than 24 hours has passed since the satisfaction of the condition to termination under Section 10.01(b)(iv).\\n\\n \\n\\n106\\n\\n \\n\\n(e)                                  If this Agreement is terminated by the Company or Parent pursuant to Section 10.01(b)(iii), the Company shall pay to Parent (or its designee), in cash and by way of compensation within three Business Days after the date of termination of this Agreement, a payment in an amount equal to $270,000,000 (the “Company No Vote Payment”); provided, that such amount shall be payable only if either (i) the Parent Shareholder Approval shall have previously been obtained or (ii) (A) the condition to termination under Section 10.01(b)(iv) has not been satisfied at the time of such termination, (B) Parent has complied with Section 8.04(c) and (C) more than 24 hours has passed since the satisfaction of the condition to termination under Section 10.01(b)(iii).\\n\\n \\n\\n(f)                                   Any payment of the Company Termination Payment or the Company No Vote Payment (each, a “Company Payment”) or the Parent Termination Payment shall be made by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account designated in writing by Parent or the Company, as applicable.  Any Company Payment or Parent Termination Payment shall be made free and clear of and without deduction or withholding of any Taxes; provided:\\n\\n \\n\\n(i)                                     in the case of the Company Payment, Parent has supplied the Company with a properly completed IRS Form W-8BEN-E, on which the Company is entitled to rely, claiming the benefits of, and establishing an exemption to withholding under, the income tax treaty between the United States and the United Kingdom prior to the payment of the Company Payment;\\n\\n \\n\\n(ii)                                  in the case of the Company Payment, in the event that deductions or withholdings on account of U.S. federal income Taxes should have been made under applicable law, then Parent shall bear the cost of such Taxes;\\n\\n \\n\\n(iii)                               in the case of the Parent Termination Payment, in the event that deductions or withholdings on account of UK income Tax should have been made under applicable law, then the Company shall bear the cost of such Taxes; and\\n\\n \\n\\n(iv)                              in the case of the Parent Termination Payment, Parent may deduct or withhold any amounts in respect of VAT required or permitted to be withheld in accordance with the following provisions of this Section 10.03.\\n\\n \\n\\n(g)                                  The parties agree and understand that (x) in no event shall the Company be required to pay the Company Termination Payment on more than one occasion or the Company No Vote Payment on more than one occasion, in each case under any circumstances, and the Company No Vote Payment shall be credited toward any subsequent payment of the Company Termination Payment, and in no event shall Parent be required to pay the Parent Termination Payment on more than one occasion under any circumstances, and (y) except in the case of fraud or Willful Breach by the other party of any covenant or agreement set forth in this Agreement, in no event shall Parent be entitled, pursuant to this Section 10.03, to receive an amount greater than the Company Termination Payment and Company No Vote Payment, as applicable (subject to the understanding that the Company No Vote Payment is set off against the Company Termination Payment when the payment of the Company Termination Payment follows the payment of the Company No Vote Payment under Section 10.03(e)), and any applicable additional amounts pursuant to the last two sentences of this Section 10.03(g) (such\\n\\n \\n\\n107\\n\\n \\n\\nadditional amounts, collectively, the “Parent Additional Amounts”), and in no event shall the Company be entitled, pursuant to this Section 10.03, to receive an amount greater than the Parent Termination Payment and any applicable additional amounts pursuant to Section 6.03(c) and/or the last two sentences of this Section 10.3(g) (such additional amounts, collectively, the “Company Additional Amounts”).  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, except in the case of fraud or Willful Breach by the other party of any covenant or agreement set forth in this Agreement, (i) if Parent receives a Company Payment and any applicable Parent Additional Amounts from the Company pursuant to this Section 10.03, or if the Company receives the Parent Termination Payment and any applicable Company Additional Amounts from Parent pursuant to this Section 10.03, such payment shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of the receiving party against the paying party and its Subsidiaries and their respective former, current or future partners, equityholders, managers, members, Affiliates and Representatives, and none of the paying party, any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective former, current or future partners, equityholders, managers, members, Affiliates or Representatives shall have any further liability or obligation, in each case relating to or arising out of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby and (ii) if (A) Parent, Bidco or either Merger Sub receives any payments from the Company in respect of any breach of this Agreement and thereafter Parent receives a Company Payment pursuant to this Section 10.03 or (B) the Company receives any payments from Parent, Bidco or either Merger Sub in respect of any breach of this Agreement and thereafter the Company receives the Parent Termination Payment, the amount of such Company Termination Payment or such Parent Termination Payment, as applicable, shall be reduced by the aggregate amount of such payments made by the party paying the Company Payment or the Parent Termination Payment, as applicable, in respect of any such breaches (in each case, after taking into account any Parent Additional Amounts or Company Additional Amounts, as applicable).  The parties acknowledge that the agreements contained in this Section 10.03 are an integral part of the transactions contemplated hereby, that, without these agreements, the parties would not enter into this Agreement and that any amounts payable pursuant to this Section 10.03 do not constitute a penalty.  Accordingly, if any party fails to promptly pay any Company Payment or the Parent Termination Payment due pursuant to this Section 10.03, such party shall also pay any out-of-pocket costs and expenses (together with any irrecoverable VAT incurred thereon, and including reasonable legal fees and expenses) incurred by the party entitled to such payment in connection with a legal action to enforce this Agreement that results in a judgment for such amount against the party failing to promptly pay such amount.  Any Company Payment or Parent Termination Payment not paid when due pursuant to this Section 10.03 shall bear interest from the date such amount is due until the date paid at a rate equal to the prime rate as published in The Wall Street Journal, Eastern Edition in effect on the date of such payment.\\n\\n \\n\\n(h)                                 The Parent Termination Payment and the Company Termination Payment (in each case if any) shall be VAT inclusive.\\n\\n \\n\\n(i)                                     The parties hereto intend that any payment of a Parent Termination Payment, being compensatory in nature, shall not be treated (in whole or in part) as consideration for a supply for the purposes of VAT and, accordingly, Parent shall:\\n\\n \\n\\n(i)                                     file its relevant VAT return on the basis that the payment of any such Parent Termination Payment falls outside the scope of VAT; and\\n\\n \\n\\n108\\n\\n \\n\\n(ii)                                  pay the full amount of any such Parent Termination Payment free and clear of any deduction or adjustment on account of VAT,\\n\\n \\n\\nit being understood and agreed that if it is finally determined that the Parent Termination Payment is (in whole or in part) consideration for a supply for the purposes of VAT then:\\n\\n \\n\\n(A)                              Parent shall (1) subject to having received the relevant amount from the Company as provided in sub-clause (C) below, promptly account for and pay to HMRC such VAT together with any associated interest and penalties; and (2) use its reasonable best efforts to recover (by refund, credit or otherwise) any such VAT at the residual recovery rate generally applied by Parent in respect of input VAT incurred on its overheads from time to time;\\n\\n \\n\\n(B)                               the amount of the Parent Termination Payment payable by Parent shall be reduced so that the sum of (1) the Parent Termination Payment (as so reduced) and (2) any VAT reverse charge thereon that Parent certifies acting in good faith that it is not entitled to recover (by way of credit or repayment) as input tax (together with any related interest or penalties in respect of such VAT reverse charge but excluding any interest or penalties arising as a result of the unreasonable delay or default of Parent), is equal to the amount of the Parent Termination Payment that would be payable but for this subclause (B) (the amount of such reduction being the “Adjustment Amount”); and\\n\\n \\n\\n(C)                               the Company covenants to pay to Parent on written demand and on an after-Tax basis an amount equal to the Adjustment Amount save to the extent that such Adjustment Amount has previously been adjusted by way of refund of such part of the Parent Termination Payment, the due date for payment of which shall be five Business Days after the date such written demand is received by the Company.\\n\\n \\n\\nThis section 10.03(i) is subject to the provisions of Section 10.03(i) of the Company Disclosure Schedule.\\n\\n \\n\\n(j)                                    Any reference in Section 10.03(i) or Section 10.03(i) of the Company Disclosure Schedule to Parent shall where applicable be regarded as referring to the representative member of any VAT group of which Parent is a member, and “finally determined” shall mean determined by HMRC or, if such determination is appealed, a court or tribunal in a decision or judgment in respect of which no right of appeal exists (or in relation to which any periods for appeal have expired) or, whether or not such determination is appealed, as provided in a binding agreement made with HMRC.\\n\\n \\n\\n(k)                                 The parties anticipate that any Company Payment shall be outside the scope of UK VAT and not otherwise subject to VAT.\\n\\n \\n\\n109\\n\\n \\n\\n(l)                                     For the purposes of Section 10.03(i)(ii)(C), and Section 10.03(i) of the Company Disclosure Schedule, a covenant or indemnity being given on an “after-Tax basis” means that the amount payable (the “Payment”) pursuant to such covenant or indemnity (as applicable) shall be calculated in such a manner as will ensure that, after taking into account: (A) any Tax required to be deducted or withheld from the Payment (save to the extent that Parent has not provided a W-8BEN-E when it was entitled to do so, and provision of a W-8BEN-E would have prevented such deduction or withholding being required) and any additional amounts required to be paid by the payer of the Payment in consequence of such withholding; (B) the amount and timing of any additional Tax which becomes (or would become, but for the use of any credit or other relief which would otherwise have been available to reduce the Tax liabilities of any member of the recipient’s Group) payable by the recipient of the Payment as a result of the Payment’s being chargeable to Tax in the hands of that person; and (C) the amount and timing of any Tax benefit which is obtained by the recipient of the Payment (or any member of the recipient’s Group) to the extent that such Tax benefit is attributable to the matter giving rise to the obligation to make the Payment or the receipt of the Payment, the recipient of the Payment is in the same position as that in which it would have been if the matter giving rise to the obligation to make a Payment under this Section 10.03(l) had not occurred, provided that if any party to this Agreement shall have assigned or novated the benefit of this Agreement in whole or in part or shall, after the date of this Agreement, have changed its Tax residence or the permanent establishment to which the rights under this Agreement are allocated then no Payment to that party shall be increased by reason of the operation of clauses (A) through (C) (inclusive) to any greater extent than would have been the case had no such assignment, novation or change taken place.  In this Section 10.03(l), references to “Tax” shall exclude “VAT” and references to a “W-8BEN-E” shall mean a properly completed IRS Form W-8BEN-E, on which the Company is entitled to rely, claiming the benefits of, and establishing an exemption to withholding under, the income tax treaty between the United States and the United Kingdom prior to such Payment.\\n\\n \\n\\n(m)                             None of the Financing Sources shall have any liability to the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or any Person that is an Affiliate of the Company prior to giving effect to the Mergers relating to or arising out of this Agreement or the Debt Financing, whether at law, or equity, in contract, in tort or otherwise, and neither the Company nor any Person that is an Affiliate of the Company prior to giving effect to the Mergers shall have any rights or claims directly against any of the Financing Sources hereunder or thereunder.  The foregoing shall not impair, supplement, or otherwise modify any of the commitments and other obligations that the Financing Sources have under any definitive agreement related to the Debt Financing to Parent, Bidco or either Merger Sub or any of the rights of Parent, Bidco or either Merger Sub against any of the Financing Sources under any definitive agreement related to the Debt Financing.\\n\\n \\n\\nARTICLE XI\\n\\n \\n\\nMISCELLANEOUS\\n\\n \\n\\nSection 11.01

Agreement may be signed in any number of counterparts, including by facsimile, by email with .pdf attachments, or by other electronic signatures (including, DocuSign and AdobeSign), each of which shall be an original, with the same effect as if the signatures thereto and hereto were upon the same instrument.  This Agreement shall become effective when each party hereto shall have received a counterpart hereof signed and delivered (by electronic communication, facsimile or otherwise) by all of the other parties hereto.  Until and unless each party has received a counterpart hereof signed by the other party hereto, this Agreement shall have no effect, and no party shall have any right or obligation hereunder (whether by virtue of any other oral or written agreement or other communication).\\n\\n \\n\\nSection 11.11                      Entire Agreement.  This Agreement and the Confidentiality Agreement constitute the entire agreement between the parties with respect to the subject matter thereof and supersede all prior agreements and understandings, both oral and written, between the parties with respect to the subject matter thereof.\\n\\n \\n\\nSection 11.12                      Severability.  If any term, provision, covenant or restriction of this Agreement is held by a court of competent jurisdiction or other Governmental Authority to be invalid, void or unenforceable, the remainder of the terms, provisions, covenants and restrictions of this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect and shall in no way be affected, impaired or invalidated so long as the economic or legal substance of the transactions contemplated hereby is not affected in any manner materially adverse to any party.  Upon such a determination, the parties shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the parties as closely as possible in an acceptable manner in order that the transactions contemplated hereby be consummated as originally contemplated to the fullest extent possible.\\n\\n \\n\\nSection 11.13                      Specific Performance.  The parties’ rights in this Section 11.13 are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.  The parties acknowledge and agree that irreparable harm would occur and that the parties would not have any adequate remedy at law (a) for any breach of any of the provisions of this Agreement or (b) in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with their specific terms.  It is accordingly agreed that (except where this Agreement is validly terminated in accordance with Section 10.01) the parties shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches or

for the securing or posting of any bond in connection with such remedy.  The parties further agree that (x) by seeking the remedies provided for in this Section 11.13, a party shall not in any respect waive its right to any other form of relief that may be available to a party under this Agreement, including, subject to Section 10.03(g), monetary damages in the event that the remedies provided for in this Section 11.13 are not available or otherwise are not granted, and (y) nothing contained in this Section 11.13 shall require any party to institute any proceeding for (or limit any party’s right to institute any proceeding for) specific performance under this Section 11.13 before exercising any termination right under Section 10.01 (and/or pursuing damages), nor shall the commencement of any action pursuant to this\\n\\n \\n\\n115\\n\\n \\n\\nSection 11.13 or anything contained in this Section 11.13 restrict or limit any party’s right to terminate this Agreement in accordance with the terms of Section 10.01 or pursue any other remedies under this Agreement that may be available then or thereafter.  In no event shall the Company or Parent be entitled to both (i) specific performance to cause the other party to consummate the Closing and (ii) the payment of the Parent Termination Payment or the Company Termination Payment, as applicable.\\n\\n \\n\\nSection 11.14                      Financing Provisions.  Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the Company on behalf of itself, its Subsidiaries and each of its controlled Affiliates hereby: (a) agrees that, except as specifically set forth in the documents relating to the Debt Financing, any proceeding, whether in law or in equity, whether in contract or in tort or otherwise,

to the Debt Financing, (c) agrees not to bring or support or permit any of its controlled Affiliates to bring or support any proceeding of any kind or description, whether in law or in equity, whether in contract or in tort or otherwise, against any Financing Source in any way arising out of or relating to, this Agreement, the Debt Financing and the documents relating thereto or any of the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby or the performance of any services thereunder in any forum other than any federal or state court in the Borough of Manhattan, New York, New York, (d) agrees that service of process on the Company or its Subsidiaries in any such proceeding shall be effective if notice is given in accordance with Section 11.01, (e) irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent that it may effectively do so, the defense of an inconvenient forum to the maintenance of such proceeding in any such court, (f) knowingly, intentionally and voluntarily waives to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law trial by jury in any proceeding brought against the Financing Sources in any way arising out of or relating to, this Agreement, the Debt Financing and the documents

Company, any of its Subsidiaries or any of its controlled Affiliates (in each case, other than Parent and its Affiliates) relating to or arising out of this Agreement, the Debt Financing and the documents relating thereto, or any of the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby or the performance of any services thereunder, whether in law or in equity, whether in contract or in tort or otherwise and (h) agrees that the Financing Sources are express Third Party beneficiaries of, and may enforce, any of the provisions of Section 10.3(k) and this Section 11.14, and that such provisions

Effective Time and as soon as practicable following the First Effective Time).\\n\\n \\n\\n(b)                                 (i) At the First Effective Time, Merger Sub I shall be merged with and into the Company in accordance with the DGCL (the “First Merger”), whereupon the separate existence of Merger Sub I shall cease and the Company shall be the surviving corporation (the “First Surviving Corporation”), such that immediately following the First Merger, the First Surviving Corporation shall be a wholly owned direct subsidiary of Bidco and (ii) immediately (or as soon as practicable) following the First Merger, and as part of the same plan, at the Second Effective Time, the First Surviving Corporation shall be merged with and into Merger Sub II in accordance with the DGCL and DLLCA (the “Second Merger” and, together with the First Merger, the “Mergers”), whereupon the separate existence of the First Surviving Corporation shall cease and Merger Sub II shall be the surviving company (the “Surviving Company”), such that immediately following the Second Merger, the Surviving Company shall be a wholly owned direct subsidiary of Bidco.\\n\\n \\n\\n(c)                                  (i) From and after the First Effective Time, the First Surviving Corporation shall possess all the rights, powers, privileges and franchises and be subject to all of the obligations, liabilities, restrictions and disabilities of the Company and Merger Sub I, all as provided under the DGCL and (ii) from and after the Second Effective Time, the

At the First Effective Time, by virtue of the First Merger and without any action on the part of Parent, Bidco, either Merger Sub, the Company or any holder of Company Common Stock, the common stock of Merger Sub I or limited liability interests in Merger Sub II:\\n\\n \\n\\n(a)                                 other than (i) shares of Company Common Stock to be cancelled or converted pursuant to Section 2.03(b) and (ii) Dissenting Shares (such shares together with the shares of Company Common Stock to be cancelled or converted pursuant to Section 2.03(b), collectively, the “Excluded Shares”), each share of Company Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the First Effective Time shall be converted into, and shall thereafter represent only, the right to receive, (A) 2.1243 (the “Exchange Ratio”) Parent ADSs (the “Share Consideration”), subject to Section 2.09 with respect to fractional Parent ADSs, and (B) $60.00 in cash without interest (the “Cash Consideration” and, together with the Share Consideration, the “Merger Consideration”) and, immediately following such conversion, shall be automatically cancelled and cease to exist (the “Cancellation”);\\n\\n \\n\\n(b)                                 (i) each share of Company Common Stock held by the Company as treasury stock or owned by Parent, Bidco or by either Merger Sub immediately prior to the First Effective Time (other than any such shares owned by Parent, Bidco or either Merger Sub in a fiduciary, representative or other capacity on behalf of other Persons, whether or not held in a separate account) shall be cancelled and shall cease to exist, and no consideration shall be paid with respect thereto and (ii) each share of Company Common Stock held by any wholly owned Subsidiary of either the Company or Parent (other than Bidco and either Merger Sub) immediately prior to the First Effective Time shall be converted into a number of validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable Parent ADSs equal to the sum of (A) the Exchange Ratio and (B) the Cash Consideration divided by the Parent ADS Price;\\n\\n \\n\\n(c)                                  each share of common stock of Merger Sub I, par value $0.01 per share, issued and outstanding immediately prior to the First Effective Time shall be converted into and become one validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the First Surviving Corporation; and\\n\\n \\n\\n(d)                                 all outstanding shares of Company Common Stock shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled and retired and shall cease to exist, and (i) each share of Company Common Stock that was, immediately prior to the First Effective Time, represented by a certificate (each, a “Certificate”) and (ii) each uncertificated share of Company Common Stock that, immediately prior to the First Effective Time, was registered to a holder on the stock transfer books of the Company (an “Uncertificated Share”) shall (in each case, other than with respect to Excluded Shares) thereafter represent only the right to receive (A) the Merger Consideration and (B) with respect to the Share Consideration, the right to receive (1) any dividends or other distributions pursuant to Section 2.05(f) and (2) any cash in lieu of any fractional Parent ADSs pursuant to Section 2.09, in each case to be issued or paid in accordance with Section 2.05, without interest.\\n\\n \\n\\nSection 2.04                             Conversion of Shares in the Second Merger.  At the Second Effective Time, by virtue of the Second Merger and without any action on the part of Parent, Bidco, either Merger Sub, the Company or any holder of common stock of the First Surviving\\n\\n \\n\\n23\\n\\n \\n\\nCorporation or common stock of Merger Sub II, (i) each limited liability company interest of Merger Sub II issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Second Effective Time shall remain outstanding as a limited liability company interest of the Surviving Company and shall not be affected by the Second Merger and (ii) each share of common stock of the First Surviving Corporation issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Second Effective Time shall be cancelled and shall cease to exist, and no consideration shall be paid with respect thereto, such that, immediately following the Second Merger, the Surviving Company shall be a direct wholly owned subsidiary of Bidco.\\n\\n \\n\\nSection 2.05                             Surrender and Payment.\\n\\n \\n\\n(a)                                 Prior to the First Effective Time, Parent and Bidco shall appoint a commercial bank or trust company reasonably acceptable to the Company (the “Exchange Agent”) and enter into an exchange agent agreement with the Exchange Agent reasonably acceptable to the Company (the “Exchange Agent Agreement”) for the purpose of exchanging (i) Certificates or (ii) Uncertificated Shares for the Merger Consideration payable in respect of the shares of Company Common Stock.  As of the First Effective Time, in consideration of and in exchange for the issuance to Parent by Bidco of 1,900 shares of common stock of Bidco and the Cancellation, Parent shall allot Parent Ordinary Shares which may be represented in uncertificated form in CREST or American depositary receipts evidencing (or evidence of Parent ADSs in book-entry form representing) the Parent ADSs issuable pursuant to Section 2.03(a).  As of the First Effective Time, Parent (in the case of (x)) and Parent or Bidco (in the case of (y)) shall deposit or cause to be deposited with the Exchange Agent, for the benefit of the holders of shares of Company Common Stock, for exchange in accordance with this Section 2.05 through the Exchange Agent, (x) American depositary receipts evidencing (or evidence of Parent ADSs in book-entry form representing) the Parent ADSs issuable pursuant to Section 2.03(a) in exchange for outstanding shares of Company Common Stock and (y) cash sufficient to pay the aggregate Cash Consideration payable pursuant to Section 2.03(a).  Parent agrees to make available, directly or indirectly, to the Exchange Agent from time to time as needed additional cash sufficient to pay any dividends or other distributions to which such holders are entitled pursuant to Section 2.05(f) and cash in lieu of any fractional Parent ADSs to which such holder is entitled pursuant to Section 2.09.  Promptly after the First Effective Time (and in no event more than two Business Days following the Closing Date), Parent shall send, or shall cause the Exchange Agent to send, to each holder of shares of Company Common Stock at the First Effective Time a letter of transmittal and instructions (which shall be in a form reasonably acceptable to the Company and substantially finalized prior to the First Effective Time and which shall specify that (A) delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title shall pass, only on proper delivery of the Certificates or transfer of the Uncertificated Shares to the Exchange Agent) for use in such exchange and (B) each holder of shares of Company Common Stock may elect to receive a number of Parent Ordinary Shares in lieu of Parent ADSs as Share Consideration pursuant to Section 2.05(g).  All certificates (or evidence of Parent ADSs in book-entry form) and cash deposited with the Exchange Agent pursuant to this Section 2.05 shall be referred to in this Agreement as the “Exchange Fund”.  Parent shall cause, or shall procure that Bidco cause, the Exchange Agent to deliver the Merger Consideration contemplated to be issued or paid pursuant to this Article II out of the Exchange Fund.  The Exchange Fund shall not be used for any other purpose.  The Exchange Agent shall invest any cash included in the Exchange Fund as directed by Parent or Bidco; provided, that such cash shall only be invested in the\\n\\n \\n\\n24\\n\\n \\n\\nmanner provided in the Exchange Agent Agreement; provided, further, that no such investment or losses thereon shall affect the Merger Consideration payable to holders of Company Common Stock entitled to receive such consideration or cash in lieu of fractional interests and, to the extent necessary to pay the Merger Consideration, Parent shall promptly cause, or shall procure that Bidco cause, to be provided additional funds to the Exchange Agent for the benefit of holders of Company Common Stock entitled to receive such consideration in the amount of any such losses.  Any interest and other income resulting from such investments shall be the property of, and paid to, Parent on termination of the Exchange Fund.\\n\\n \\n\\n(b)                                 Each holder of shares of Company Common Stock that have been converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration shall be entitled to receive, on (i) surrender to the Exchange Agent of a Certificate, together with a properly completed and duly executed letter of transmittal, or (ii) receipt of an “agent’s message” by the Exchange Agent (or such other evidence, if any, of transfer as the Exchange Agent may reasonably request) in the case of a book-entry transfer of Uncertificated Shares, the Merger Consideration in respect of each share of the Company Common Stock represented by such Certificate or Uncertificated Share (including cash in lieu of any fractional Parent ADSs and any dividends and distributions with respect to the Share Consideration as contemplated by Section 2.05(f) and Section 2.09).  The Parent ADSs constituting the Share Consideration, at Parent’s option, shall be in uncertificated book-entry form, unless a physical American depository receipt evidencing such Parent ADSs is requested by a holder of shares of Company Common Stock or is otherwise required under Applicable Law.\\n\\n \\n\\n(c)                                  If any portion of the Merger Consideration (or cash in lieu of any fractional Parent ADSs or any dividends and distributions with respect to the Share Consideration as contemplated by Section 2.05(f) and Section 2.09) is to be paid to a Person other than the Person in whose name the surrendered Certificate or the transferred Uncertificated Share is registered, it shall be a condition to such payment that (i) either such Certificate shall be properly endorsed or shall otherwise be in proper form for transfer or such Uncertificated Share shall be properly transferred and (ii) the Person requesting such payment shall pay to the Exchange Agent any stamp duty, stamp duty reserve tax, transfer or similar Taxes required as a result of such payment to a Person other than the registered holder of such Certificate or Uncertificated Share or establish to the satisfaction of the Exchange Agent that such stamp duty, stamp duty reserve tax, transfer or similar Taxes have been paid or are not payable.\\n\\n \\n\\n(d)                                 From and after the First Effective Time, there shall be no further registration of transfers of shares of Company Common Stock thereafter on the records of the Company.  If, after the First Effective Time, Certificates or Uncertificated Shares are presented to Parent, the First Surviving Corporation, the Surviving Company or the Exchange Agent for any reason, they shall be cancelled and exchanged for the Merger Consideration (and cash in lieu of any fractional Parent ADSs and any dividends and distributions with respect to the Share Consideration as contemplated by Section 2.05(f) and Section 2.09) with respect thereto in accordance with the procedures set forth in, or as otherwise contemplated by, this Article II (including this Section 2.05).\\n\\n \\n\\n(e)                                  Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains unclaimed by the holders of shares of Company Common Stock 12 months following the Closing Date shall be delivered\\n\\n \\n\\n25\\n\\n \\n\\nto Parent or as otherwise instructed by Parent, and any such holder who has not exchanged shares of Company Common Stock for the Merger Consideration in accordance with this Section 2.05 prior to that time shall thereafter look only to Parent for payment of the Merger Consideration (and cash in lieu of any fractional Parent ADSs and any dividends and distributions with respect to the Share Consideration as contemplated by Section 2.05(f) and Section 2.09), without any interest thereon.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent and its Subsidiaries (including Bidco, the Surviving Company and its Subsidiaries) shall not be liable to any holder of shares of Company Common Stock for any amounts properly paid to a public official in compliance with applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar laws.  Any amounts remaining unclaimed by holders of shares of Company Common Stock immediately prior to such time when the amounts would otherwise escheat to or become property of any Governmental Authority shall become, to the extent permitted by Applicable Law, the property of Parent free and clear of any claims or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto.\\n\\n \\n\\n(f)                                   Following the surrender of any Certificates, along with the delivery of a properly completed and duly executed letter of transmittal, or the transfer of any Uncertificated Shares, in each case as provided in this Section 2.05, Parent shall pay, or cause to be paid, without interest, to the Person in whose name the Parent ADSs constituting the Share Consideration have been registered, (i) in connection with the payment of the Share Consideration, (x) the amount of any cash payable in lieu of fractional shares to which such Person is entitled pursuant to Section 2.09, and (y) the aggregate amount of all dividends or other distributions payable with respect to such Parent ADSs, with a record date on or after the First Effective Time that were paid prior to the time of such surrender or transfer, and (ii) at the appropriate payment date after the payment of the Merger Consideration, the amount of all dividends or other distributions payable with respect to whole Parent ADSs constituting the Share Consideration with a record date on or after the First Effective Time and prior to the time of such surrender or transfer and with a payment date subsequent to the time of such surrender or transfer.  No dividends or other distributions with respect to Parent ADSs constituting the Share Consideration, and no cash payment in lieu of fractional shares pursuant to Section 2.09, shall be paid to the holder of any Certificates not surrendered or of any Uncertificated Shares not transferred until such Certificates are surrendered and the holder thereof delivers a properly completed and duly executed letter of transmittal or such or Uncertificated Shares are transferred, as the case may be, as provided in this Section 2.05.\\n\\n \\n\\n(g)                                  Notwithstanding anything in this Section 2.05 to the contrary, Parent shall cooperate with the Exchange Agent and ADS Depository, as necessary, to provide for (i) the ability of holders of Company Common Stock to elect to receive Parent Ordinary Shares in lieu of Parent ADSs and (ii) the delivery of such Parent Ordinary Shares in lieu of Parent ADSs as the Share Consideration (and in satisfaction of such obligation) to the extent elected by the holders of shares of Company Common Stock pursuant to Section 2.05(a).  The number of Parent Ordinary Shares to be delivered in lieu of Parent ADSs shall be the number of underlying Parent Ordinary Shares represented by such Parent ADSs, subject to the delivery of cash in lieu of fractional Parent Ordinary Shares in accordance with this Section 2.05 and Section 2.09 which sections shall be applied mutatis mutandis with respect to those holders of Company Common Stock that elect to receive Parent Ordinary Shares in lieu of Parent ADSs.\\n\\n \\n\\n26\\n\\n \\n\\nSection 2.06                             Dissenting Shares.  Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, shares of Company Common Stock that are issued and outstanding immediately prior to the First Effective Time and that are held by a stockholder who is entitled to demand, and properly demands, appraisal of such shares pursuant to, and who complies in all respects with, the provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL (such stockholders, the “Dissenting Stockholders” and, such shares of Company Common Stock, the “Dissenting Shares”), shall not be converted into or be exchangeable for the right to receive the Merger Consideration, but instead such holder shall be entitled to payment of the fair value of such Dissenting Shares in accordance with the provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL (and, at the First Effective Time, such Dissenting Shares shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled and shall cease to exist, and such holder shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the fair value of such Dissenting Shares in accordance with the provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL), unless and until such holder shall have failed to perfect or shall have effectively waived, withdrawn or lost rights to appraisal under the DGCL.  If any Dissenting Stockholders shall have failed to perfect or shall have effectively waived, withdrawn or lost such rights, the Dissenting Shares held by such Dissenting Stockholder shall thereupon be deemed to have been converted into, as of the First Effective Time, and shall thereafter represent only the right to receive, the Merger Consideration as provided in Section 2.03(a) (and cash in lieu of any fractional Parent ADSs and any dividends and distributions with respect thereto as contemplated by Section 2.05(f) and Section 2.09), without interest, and immediately following such cancellation shall be automatically cancelled and cease to exist.  The Company shall give Parent prompt notice of any written demands for appraisal of any shares of Company Common Stock, attempted withdrawals of such demands and any other instruments served pursuant to the DGCL and received by the Company relating to stockholders’ rights of appraisal in accordance with the provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL, and Parent the opportunity to participate in all negotiations and proceedings with respect to all such demands.  The Company shall not, except with the prior written consent of Parent, make any payment with respect to, settle or offer or agree to settle any such demands.  Any portion of the Merger Consideration made available to the Exchange Agent pursuant to Section 2.05 to pay for shares of Company Common Stock for which appraisal rights have been perfected shall be returned to Parent (or to Bidco if Parent so directs) on demand.\\n\\n \\n\\nSection 2.07                             Company Equity Awards.\\n\\n \\n\\n(a)                                 Company Stock Options.  At the First Effective Time, each compensatory option to purchase shares of Company Common Stock granted under any Company Stock Plan that is outstanding and unexercised immediately prior to the First Effective Time (each, a “Company Stock Option”), whether or not vested shall, by virtue of the First Merger and without further action on the part of the holder thereof, be cancelled in consideration for the right to receive, within five Business Days following the First Effective Time, the Merger Consideration, without interest and less applicable withholding Taxes, in respect of each Net Option Share subject to such Company Stock Option immediately prior to the First Effective Time.  For purposes of this Agreement, “Net Option Share” means, with respect to a Company Stock Option, the quotient obtained by dividing (i) the product obtained by multiplying (A) the excess, if any, of the value of the Merger Consideration over the exercise price per share of Company Common Stock subject to such Company Stock Option immediately prior to the First Effective Time by (B) the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Company Stock\\n\\n \\n\\n27\\n\\n \\n\\nOption immediately prior to the First Effective Time by (ii) the value of the Merger Consideration.  For purposes of the preceding sentence, the value of the component of the Merger Consideration that consists of Parent ADSs shall equal the product of (x) the Exchange Ratio and (y) the Parent ADS Price.\\n\\n \\n\\n(b)                                 Company Restricted Stock Units.  At the First Effective Time, each restricted stock unit award with respect to shares of Company Common Stock outstanding under any Company Stock Plan that vests solely based on the passage of time (each, a “Company RSU Award”) shall be treated as set forth in this Section 2.07.\\n\\n \\n\\n(i)                                     At the First Effective Time, each Company RSU Award held by a non-employee director shall, by virtue of the First Merger and without further action on the part of the holder thereof, become fully vested and cancelled and converted into the right to receive, within five Business Days following the First Effective Time, the Merger Consideration, without interest and less applicable withholding Taxes, with respect to each share of Company Common Stock subject to such Company RSU Award (or portion thereof) immediately prior to the First Effective Time; provided, that if application of this Section 2.07(b)(i) to any such Company RSU Award (or portion thereof) would result in the imposition of a penalty under Section 409A of the Code, then such Company RSU Award (or portion thereof) shall instead be converted into an Assumed RSU Award in accordance with Section 2.07(b)(ii).\\n\\n \\n\\n(ii)                                  At the First Effective Time, each Company RSU Award (or portion thereof) that is not covered by Section 2.07(b)(i) shall be assumed by Parent and shall be converted into a restricted unit award (each, an “Assumed RSU Award”) that settles in a number of Parent ADSs equal to the number of shares of Company Common Stock underlying the Company RSU Award (or portion thereof) multiplied by the Equity Award Exchange Ratio, rounded up to the nearest whole number of shares.  Each Assumed RSU Award shall continue to have, and shall be subject to, the same terms and conditions as applied to the corresponding Company RSU Award immediately prior to the First Effective Time (including any terms and conditions relating to accelerated vesting on a termination of the holder’s employment in connection with or following the Merger).\\n\\n \\n\\n(c)                                  Company Performance-Based Restricted Stock Units.  At the First Effective Time, each restricted stock unit award with respect to shares of Company Common Stock outstanding under any Company Stock Plan that vests based on the achievement of performance goals (each, a “Company PSU Award”) shall, by virtue of the First Merger and without further action on the part of the holder thereof, be assumed by Parent and converted into a restricted unit award (each, an “Assumed PSU Award”) that settles in a number of Parent ADSs equal to the product of the number of shares of Company Common Stock underlying the Company PSU Award (with such number of shares determined by deeming the applicable performance goals to be achieved at the greater of (i) the target level and (ii) the actual level of achievement through the latest practicable date prior to the First Effective Time as determined by the Leadership and Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of the Company prior to the First Effective Time), subject to a limit of 175% of target for Company PSU Awards granted in 2019 and subject to a limit of 150% of target for Company PSU Awards granted in 2020\\n\\n \\n\\n28\\n\\n \\n\\nmultiplied by the Equity Award Exchange Ratio, rounded up to the nearest whole number of shares.  Each Assumed PSU Award shall continue to have, and shall be subject to, the same terms and conditions as applied to the corresponding Company PSU Award (other than performance-based vesting conditions) immediately prior to the First Effective Time (including any terms and conditions relating to accelerated vesting on a termination of the holder’s employment in connection with or following the Merger).\\n\\n \\n\\n(d)                                 Reservation of Shares.  As soon as practicable following the Closing Date (but in no event more than five Business Days following the Closing Date), Parent shall file a registration statement on Form S-8 (or any successor form) or, if required, Form F-3 (or any successor form), with respect to the issuance of the Parent ADSs subject to the Assumed RSU Awards and the Assumed PSU Awards and shall use reasonable best efforts to maintain the effectiveness of such registration statement or registration statements (and maintain the current status of the prospectus or prospectuses contained therein) for so long as the Assumed RSU Awards and the Assumed PSU Awards remain outstanding.\\n\\n \\n\\n(e)                                  Board Actions.  Prior to the First Effective Time, the Board of Directors of the Company (and/or the Leadership and Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of the Company) and the Board of Directors of Parent (and/or the Remuneration Committee of the Board of Directors of Parent) shall adopt such resolutions as are necessary to give effect to the transactions contemplated by this Section 2.07.\\n\\n \\n\\n(f)                                   Company ESPP.  As soon as practicable following the date of this Agreement, the Board of Directors of the Company (or, if appropriate, any committee administering the Company ESPP) shall adopt such resolutions or take such other actions as may be required so that (i) participation in the Company ESPP shall be limited to those employees who are participants on the date of this Agreement, (ii) except to the extent necessary to maintain the status of the Company ESPP as an “employee stock purchase plan” within the meaning of Section 423 of the Code and the Treasury Regulations thereunder, participants may not increase their payroll deduction elections or rate of contributions from those in effect on the date of this Agreement or make any separate non-payroll contributions to the Company ESPP on or following the date of this Agreement, (iii) no offering period shall be commenced after the date of this Agreement, and (iv) the Company ESPP shall terminate, effective on the earlier of the first purchase date following the date of this Agreement and the fifth trading day before the First Effective Time, but subsequent to the exercise of purchase rights on such purchase date (in accordance with the terms of the Company ESPP).\\n\\n \\n\\nSection 2.08                             Adjustments.  Without limiting or affecting any of the provisions of Section 6.01 or Section 7.01, if, during the period between the date of this Agreement and the First Effective Time, any change in the outstanding Parent ADSs or outstanding Parent Ordinary Shares shall occur as a result of any reclassification, recapitalization, stock split (including reverse stock split), merger, offer (as defined in the U.K. Code), combination, scheme, exchange or readjustment of shares, subdivision or other similar transaction, or any stock dividend or distribution thereon with a record date during such period, the Merger Consideration and any other amounts payable pursuant to this Agreement shall be appropriately adjusted to provide the holders of shares of Company Common Stock and/or Company Equity Awards with the same economic effect as contemplated by this Agreement prior to such event.\\n\\n \\n\\n29\\n\\n \\n\\nSection 2.09                             Fractional ADSs.  Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, no fractional Parent ADSs shall be issued in the First Merger.  Each holder of shares of Company Common Stock who would otherwise have been entitled to receive as a result of the First Merger a fraction of a Parent ADS (after aggregating all shares represented by the Certificates and Uncertificated Shares delivered by such holder) shall receive, in lieu thereof, cash (without interest) in an amount (rounded down to the nearest cent) representing such holder’s proportionate interest in the net proceeds from the sale by the Exchange Agent on behalf of all such holders of fractional Parent ADSs that would otherwise be issued.\\n\\n \\n\\nSection 2.10                             Withholding Rights.  Each of the Exchange Agent, Parent, Bidco, the First Surviving Corporation, the Surviving Company, and the Company shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as are required to be deducted and withheld with respect to the making of such payment under any provision of federal, state, local or non-U.S. Tax law.  To the extent amounts so deducted and withheld are paid over to the appropriate Taxing Authority, such amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the Person in respect of which the deduction and withholding were made.\\n\\n \\n\\nSection 2.11                             Lost Certificates.  If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, on the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if reasonably required by the Surviving Company or the Exchange Agent, the posting by such Person of a customary bond issued for lost, stolen or destroyed stock certificates, in such reasonable amount as the Surviving Company or the Exchange Agent may direct, as indemnity against any claim that may be made against the Surviving Company or the Exchange Agent, with respect to such Certificate, the Exchange Agent shall, if such holder has otherwise delivered a properly completed and duly executed letter of transmittal, issue, in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate, the Merger Consideration to be paid in

or submission of any Company Acquisition Proposal, (ii) (A) enter into or participate in any discussions or negotiations regarding, (B) furnish to any Third Party any information, or (C) otherwise

Company Stockholder Approval (the “Company Approval Time”), the Board of Directors of the Company receives a bona fide written Company Acquisition Proposal made after the date of this Agreement that has not resulted from a violation of this Section 6.02, the Board of Directors of the Company, directly or indirectly through its Representatives, may (i) contact the Third Party that has made such Company Acquisition Proposal in order to ascertain facts or clarify terms for the sole purpose of the Board of Directors of the Company informing itself about such Company Acquisition Proposal and such Third Party and (ii) if the Board of Directors of the Company\\n\\n \\n\\n73\\n\\n \\n\\ndetermines in good faith, after consultation with its financial advisor and outside legal counsel, that such Company Acquisition Proposal is or could reasonably be expected to lead to a Company Superior Proposal, (A) subject to compliance with this Section 6.02, engage in negotiations or discussions with such Third Party and (B) furnish to such Third Party and its Representatives and financing sources non-public information relating to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries pursuant to a confidentiality agreement that (1) does not contain any provision that would prevent the Company from complying with its obligation to provide disclosure to Parent pursuant to this Section 6.02 and (2) contains confidentiality and use provisions that, in each case, are no less favorable in the aggregate to the Company than those contained in the Confidentiality Agreement; provided, that all such non-public information (to the extent that such information has not been previously provided or made available to Parent) is provided or made available to Parent, as the case may be, substantially concurrently with the time it is provided or made available to such Third Party.  Nothing contained herein shall prevent the Board of Directors of the Company from (x) taking and disclosing to the stockholders of the Company a position contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a), Rule 14d-9 or Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A promulgated under the 1934 Act, or (y) making any required disclosure to the stockholders of the Company if the Board of Directors of the Company determines in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel, that the failure to take such action would be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with Applicable Law; provided, that any such action or disclosure that constitutes a Company Adverse Recommendation Change shall be made in compliance with the applicable provisions of this Section 6.02.  A “stop, look and listen” disclosure pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) under the 1934 Act in connection with a tender or exchange offer shall not constitute a Company Adverse Recommendation Change.\\n\\n \\n\\n(c)                                  The Company shall notify Parent as promptly as practicable (but in no event later than 24 hours) after receipt by the Company (or any of its Representatives) of any Company Acquisition Proposal or any request for information relating to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries that, to the knowledge of the Company, has been or is reasonably likely to have been made in connection with any Company Acquisition Proposal, which notice shall be provided in writing and shall identify the Third Party making, and the material terms and conditions of, any such Company Acquisition Proposal or request.  The Company shall thereafter (i) keep Parent reasonably informed, on a reasonably current basis, of any material changes in the status and details (or any changes to the type and amount of consideration) of any such Company Acquisition Proposal or request and (ii) as promptly as practicable (but in no event later than 24 hours after receipt) provide to Parent copies of any material written correspondence, proposals or indications of interest relating to the terms and conditions of such Company Acquisition Proposal or request provided to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (as well as written summaries of any material oral communications relating to the terms and conditions of any Company Acquisition Proposal).\\n\\n \\n\\n(d)                                 Anything in this Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding, prior to the Company Approval Time, in response to a Company Acquisition Proposal that the Board of Directors of the Company determines in good faith constitutes a Company Superior Proposal, the Board of Directors of the Company may, subject to compliance with this Section 6.02(d), (i) make a Company Adverse Recommendation Change and/or (ii) terminate this Agreement in accordance with Section 10.01(d)(iii); provided, that (A) the Company shall first notify Parent in writing at least four Business Days before taking such action that the Company intends to take\\n\\n \\n\\n74\\n\\n \\n\\nsuch action, which notice shall include an unredacted copy of such proposal and a copy of any financing commitments (in the form provided to the Company) relating thereto (and, to the extent not in writing, the material terms and conditions thereof and the identity of the person making any such proposal), (B) the Company shall make its Representatives reasonably available to negotiate with Parent and its Representatives during such four Business Day notice period, to the extent Parent wishes to negotiate, to enable Parent to propose revisions to the terms of this Agreement such that it would cause such Company Superior Proposal to no longer constitute a Company Superior Proposal, (C) upon the end of such notice period, the Board of Directors of the Company shall have considered in good faith any revisions to the terms of this Agreement committed to in writing by Parent, and shall have determined that the Company Superior Proposal would nevertheless continue to constitute a Company Superior Proposal if the revisions committed to in writing by Parent were to be given effect and (D) in the event of any change, from time to time, to any of the financial terms or any other material terms of such Company Superior Proposal, the Company shall, in each case, have delivered to Parent an additional notice consistent with that described in clause (A) of this proviso and a new notice period under clause (A) of this proviso shall commence each time, except each such notice period shall be three Business Days (instead of four Business Days), during which time the Company shall be required to comply with the requirements of this Section 6.02(d) anew with respect to each such additional notice, including clauses (A) through (D) above of this proviso.\\n\\n \\n\\n(e)                                  Anything in this Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding, at any time prior to the Company Approval Time, the Board of Directors of the Company may effect a Company Adverse Recommendation Change in response or relating to a Company Intervening Event if the Board of Directors of the Company determines in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel, that the failure to take such action would be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under Applicable Law; provided, that (i) the Company shall first notify Parent in writing at least four Business Days before taking such action of its intention to take such action, which notice shall include a reasonably detailed description of such Company Intervening Event, (ii) if requested by Parent, the Company shall make its Representatives reasonably available to negotiate with Parent and its Representatives during such four Business Day period following such notice regarding any proposal by Parent to amend the terms of this Agreement in response to such Company Intervening Event, and (iii) the Board of Directors of the Company shall not effect any Company Adverse Recommendation Change involving or relating to a Company Intervening Event unless, after the four Business Day period described in the foregoing clause (ii), the Board of Directors of the Company determines in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel and taking into account any written commitment by Parent to amend the terms of this Agreement during such four Business Day period, that the failure to take such action would continue to be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under Applicable Law.\\n\\n \\n\\n(f)                                   The Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, and shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause its and its Subsidiaries’ Representatives to, cease immediately and cause to be terminated any and all existing discussions or negotiations, if any, with any Third Party conducted prior to or ongoing as of the date of this Agreement with respect to any actual or potential (including if such discussions or negotiations were for the purpose of soliciting any) Company Acquisition Proposal or with respect to any indication, proposal or inquiry that could reasonably be expected to lead to a Company Acquisition Proposal and shall use its reasonable\\n\\n \\n\\n75\\n\\n \\n\\nbest efforts to cause any such Third Party (and any of its Representatives) in possession of confidential information about the Company or any of its Subsidiaries that was furnished by or on behalf of the Company in connection with such discussions or negotiations to return or destroy all such information.\\n\\n \\n\\nSection 6.03                             Financing Assistance.\\n\\n \\n\\n(a)                                 Prior to the Closing, the Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, use its and their commercially reasonable efforts to provide such cooperation that is customary as may be reasonably requested by Parent to assist Parent in arranging, obtaining or syndicating the debt financing provided by the Bridge Facility Agreement (or any financing intended to replace or refinance the debt financing provided by the Bridge Facility Agreement) or any other third party debt financing necessary or incurred by Parent, any wholly owned Subsidiary of Parent or any Merger Sub to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby (the “Debt Financing”) (provided, that such requested cooperation does not unreasonably interfere with the ongoing business or operations of the Company and its Subsidiaries or require the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to waive or amend any terms of this Agreement), including using commercially reasonable efforts to:\\n\\n \\n\\n(i)                                     reasonably cooperate with the customary marketing efforts or due diligence efforts of Parent in connection with all or any portion of the Debt Financing, including making available members of the management team with appropriate seniority and expertise to assist in preparation for and to participate in a mutually agreed number (on reasonable notice) of meetings, presentations, road shows, due diligence sessions, drafting sessions and sessions with proposed lenders, underwriters, initial purchasers, placement agents,

accountants and/or auditors to provide customary cooperation with the Debt Financing,\\n\\n \\n\\n(iv)                              (I) to the extent customary for Parent to prepare marketing materials for any Debt Financing of the applicable type, furnish Parent and the applicable Financing Sources with (A) audited consolidated balance sheets and related audited statements of operations, comprehensive income, stockholders’ equity and cash flows of the Company for each of the three fiscal years most recently ended more than sixty (60) days prior to the Closing Date, (B) unaudited consolidated balance sheets and related unaudited consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, stockholders’ equity and cash flows of the Company for each subsequent interim quarterly period ended more than 40 days prior to the Closing Date, in the case of each of clauses (I)(A) and (I)(B), prepared in accordance with GAAP, and (C) if the Parent is pursuing a\\n\\n \\n\\n76\\n\\n \\n\\nregistered public offering of debt securities and has notified the Company of such election, such other historical financial and other information of the type required by Regulation S-X and Regulation S-K under the 1933 Act in each case that is customary for such offering or as otherwise necessary to permit the Company’s independent accountants and/or auditors to issue customary “comfort letters” to Parent’s Financing Sources in connection with such offering, including as to customary negative assurances required to consummate such offering (it being understood that the Company need only to provide information to assist the Parent in the preparation of pro forma financial information, and shall not in any event be required to provide pro forma financial statements, projections or pro forma adjustments), and (II) furnish Parent and its Financing Sources with such other customary information relating to the Company and its Subsidiaries that is reasonably requested by Parent and is customarily required in marketing materials for Debt Financings of the applicable type.\\n\\n \\n\\n(v)                                 provide to Parent and the

foregoing unless and until the Closing occurs and it being understood that at the Closing, Parent and its Subsidiaries shall provide the Company and its Subsidiaries with the funds necessary for the

any of its Subsidiaries.\\n\\n \\n\\n(b)                                 The foregoing notwithstanding, neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries shall be required to (i) take or permit the taking of any action pursuant to Section 6.03(a) that (A) would require the Company, its Subsidiaries or any Persons who are directors or\\n\\n \\n\\n77\\n\\n \\n\\nofficers of the Company or its

reasonable and documented out-of-pocket costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys’ fees) incurred by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries in connection with the Debt Financing or satisfying its obligations under this Section 6.03, whether or not the Mergers are consummated or this Agreement is terminated (excluding, for the avoidance of doubt, the costs of the preparation of any annual

indemnify and hold harmless the Company and its Subsidiaries and their respective Representatives from and against any and all losses, claims, damages, liabilities, reasonable out-of-pocket costs, reasonable out-of-pocket attorneys’ fees, judgments, fines, penalties and amounts paid in settlement (including all interest, assessments and other charges paid or payable in connection with or in respect of any thereof) suffered or incurred in connection with the Debt Financing or otherwise in connection with any action taken by the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective Representatives pursuant to this Section 6.03 (other than the use of any information provided by the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective Representatives in writing for use in connection with the Debt Financing) whether or not the Mergers are\\n\\n \\n\\n78\\n\\n \\n\\nconsummated or this Agreement is terminated, except in the event such losses, claims, damages, liabilities, reasonable out-of-pocket costs reasonable out-of-pocket attorneys’ fees, judgments, fines, penalties and amounts paid in settlement (including all interest, assessments and other charges paid or payable in connection with or in respect of any thereof) arise out of or result from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of the Company or its Subsidiaries in fulfilling their obligations pursuant to this Section 6.03.\\n\\n \\n\\n(d)                                 Anything to the contrary in this Agreement notwithstanding,(i) the parties hereto acknowledge and agree that the provisions contained in this Section 6.03 represent the sole obligation of the Company, its Subsidiaries and their respective Representatives with respect to cooperation in connection with the arrangement of any financing (including the Debt Financing) to be obtained by Parent, Bidco or either Merger Sub with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and no other provision of this Agreement (including the Exhibits and Schedules hereto) shall be deemed to expand or modify such obligations; (ii) the Company’s breach of any of the covenants required to be performed by it under this Section 6.03 shall not be considered in determining the satisfaction of the condition set forth in Section 9.02(a) unless such breach is the primary cause of, or primarily resulted in, Parent being unable to consummate the Mergers; and (iii) the receipt and availability of any funds or financing is not a condition to Closing under this Agreement nor is it a condition to Closing under this Agreement for Parent to obtain all or any portion of the Debt Financing or any other financing.\\n\\n \\n\\n(e)                                  All confidential information provided by Company, its Subsidiaries and their respective Representatives shall be kept confidential in accordance with the Confidentiality Agreement, except that Parent shall be permitted to disclose such information as applicable to any number of Financing Sources as would be reasonable and customary in connection with any financing; provided, that all confidential information shared with Financing Sources shall be kept confidential and otherwise treated in accordance with the Confidentiality Agreement or other confidentiality obligations that are substantially similar to those contained in the Confidentiality Agreement (which, with respect to the Financing Sources, may be satisfied by the confidentiality provisions applicable thereto under the Bridge Facility Agreement or other customary confidentiality undertakings in the context of customary syndication practices from Financing Sources not party to the Bridge Facility Agreement).\\n\\n \\n\\nARTICLE VII\\n\\n \\n\\nCOVENANTS OF PARENT, BIDCO AND MERGER SUBS\\n\\n \\n\\nSection 7.01                             Conduct of Parent.\\n\\n \\n\\n(a)                                 From the date of this Agreement until the earlier of the First Effective Time and the termination of this Agreement, except (x) as prohibited or required by Applicable Law, (y) as set forth in Section 7.01 of the Parent Disclosure Schedule, or (z) as otherwise required or expressly contemplated by this Agreement, unless the Company shall have given its prior written consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), Parent shall, and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to, use commercially reasonable efforts to conduct its business in all material respects in the ordinary course of business; provided, that (i) no action by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries to the extent expressly permitted\\n\\n \\n\\n79\\n\\n \\n\\nby an exception to any of Section 7.01(b)(i) through Section 7.01(b)(vi) shall be a breach of this sentence and (ii) Parent’s or any of its Subsidiaries’ failure to take any action prohibited by any of Section 7.01(b)(i) through Section 7.01(b)(vi) shall not be deemed to be a breach of this Section 7.01(a).\\n\\n \\n\\n(b)                                 From the date of this Agreement until the earlier of the First Effective Time and the termination of this Agreement, except (x) as prohibited or required by Applicable Law, (y) as set forth in Section 7.01 of the Parent Disclosure Schedule, or (z) as otherwise required or expressly contemplated by this Agreement, without the Company’s prior written consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), Parent shall not, and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries not to:\\n\\n \\n\\n(i)                                     adopt or propose any change (A) to the Parent Organizational Documents that would adversely impact the rights of the holders of the Parent Ordinary Shares or the holders of the Parent ADSs, or (B) the organizational documents of Bidco or either Merger Sub;\\n\\n \\n\\n(ii)                                  (A) split, combine or reclassify any shares of Parent, (B) declare, set aside or pay any dividend or make any other distribution (whether in cash, stock, property or any combination thereof) in respect of any shares of Parent, other than regular cash dividends in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice (including with respect to the timing of declaration, and the record and payment dates) in an amount not to exceed $1.60 per Parent ADS in any 12-month period (appropriately adjusted to reflect any stock dividends, subdivisions, splits, combinations or other similar events relating to the Parent ADSs), or (C) redeem, repurchase, cancel or otherwise acquire or offer to redeem, repurchase, or otherwise acquire any of the Equity Securities of Parent, other than repurchases of Parent Ordinary Shares or

satisfaction of any amounts required to be deducted or withheld under Applicable Law), in each case outstanding as of the date of this Agreement in accordance with the present terms of such Parent Equity Awards or granted after the date of this Agreement to the extent permitted by this Agreement;\\n\\n \\n\\n(iii)                               issue, deliver or sell, or authorize the issuance, delivery or sale of any shares of Parent, other than (A) the issuance of any shares of Parent Ordinary Shares or Parent ADSs on the exercise, vesting or settlement of Parent Equity Awards, (B) the grant of Parent Equity Awards to employees, directors or individual independent contractors of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries pursuant to Parent’s equity compensation plans or (C) in connection

as a result of the transaction, of the publicly traded company;\\n\\n \\n\\n(v)                                 take any action or knowingly fail to take any action where such action or failure to act could reasonably be expected to (A) prevent or impede the Mergers, taken together, from qualifying as a “reorganization” within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code or (B) cause the stockholders of the Company (other than any Excepted Stockholder) to recognize gain pursuant to Section 367(a)(1) of the Code; or\\n\\n \\n\\n(vi)                              agree, resolve, commit or propose to do any of the foregoing.\\n\\n \\n\\n(c)                                  Anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement notwithstanding, Parent shall not, and shall cause its Affiliates not to, directly or indirectly (whether by merger, consolidation or otherwise), acquire, purchase, lease or license or otherwise enter into a transaction with (or agree to acquire, purchase, lease or license or otherwise enter into a transaction with) any business, corporation, partnership, association or other business organization or division or part thereof that has one or more products, whether marketed or in development, that compete, or if commercialized would compete, with one or more Company Products, if doing so would reasonably be expected to (i) impose any material delay in the satisfaction of, or increase materially the risk of not satisfying the conditions set forth in Section 9.01(c) (to the extent related to any Antitrust Law) or the conditions set forth in Section 9.01(h); (ii) materially increase the risk of any Governmental Authority entering an Order prohibiting or enjoining the consummation of the Mergers; or (iii) otherwise prevent or materially delay the consummation of the Mergers (including the Debt Financing).  The fact that a merger, acquisition or similar transaction requires approval under the Antitrust Laws shall not in and of itself restrict such transaction under this Section 7.01(c).\\n\\n \\n\\nSection 7.02                             No Solicitation by Parent.\\n\\n \\n\\n(a)                                 From the date of this Agreement until the earlier of the First Effective Time and the termination of this Agreement, except as otherwise set forth in this Section 7.02, Parent shall not, and shall cause its Subsidiaries and its and its Subsidiaries’ respective directors and officers to not, and shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause its and its Subsidiaries’ other respective Representatives to not, directly or indirectly, (i) solicit, initiate, knowingly facilitate or knowingly encourage (including by way of furnishing information) any inquiries regarding, or the making or submission of any Parent Acquisition Proposal, (ii) (A) enter into or participate in any discussions or negotiations regarding, (B) furnish to any Third Party any information, or (C) otherwise assist, participate in, knowingly facilitate or knowingly encourage any Third Party, in each case, in connection with or for the purpose of knowingly encouraging or facilitating, a Parent Acquisition Proposal, (iii) approve, recommend or enter into, or publicly or formally propose to approve, recommend or enter into, any letter of intent or similar document, agreement, commitment, or agreement in principle (whether written or oral, binding or nonbinding) with respect to a Parent Acquisition Proposal, (iv) (A) withdraw or qualify, amend or modify in any manner adverse to the Company the Parent Board Recommendation, (B) fail to include the Parent Board Recommendation in the Parent Circular or (C) recommend, adopt or approve or publicly propose to recommend, adopt or approve any Parent Acquisition

“fair price”, “supermajority”, “affiliate transactions” or “business combination statute or regulation” or other similar anti-takeover laws and regulations of the State of Delaware, including Section 203 of the DGCL, inapplicable to any Third Party or any Parent Acquisition Proposal.\\n\\n \\n\\n(b)                                 The foregoing notwithstanding, if at any time prior to the receipt of the Parent Shareholder Approval (the “Parent Approval Time”), the Board of Directors of Parent receives a bona fide written Parent Acquisition Proposal made after the date of this Agreement that has not resulted from a violation of this Section 7.02, the Board of Directors of Parent, directly or indirectly through its Representatives, may (i) contact the Third Party that has made such Parent Acquisition Proposal in order to ascertain facts or clarify terms for the sole purpose of the Board of Directors of Parent informing itself about such Parent Acquisition Proposal and such Third Party and (ii) if the Board of Directors of Parent determines in good faith, after consultation with its financial advisor and outside legal counsel, that such Parent Acquisition Proposal is or could reasonably be expected to lead to a Parent Superior Proposal, (A) subject to compliance with this Section 7.02, engage in negotiations or discussions with such Third Party and (B) furnish to such Third Party and its Representatives and financing sources non-public information relating to Parent or any of its Subsidiaries pursuant to a confidentiality agreement that (1) does not contain any provision that would prevent Parent from complying with its obligation to provide disclosure to the Company pursuant to this Section 7.02 and (2) contains confidentiality and use provisions that, in each case, are no less favorable in the aggregate to Parent than those contained in the Confidentiality Agreement; provided, that all such non-public information (to the extent that such information has not been previously provided or made available to the Company) is provided or made available to the Company, as the case may be, substantially concurrently with the time it is provided or made available to such Third Party.  Nothing contained herein shall prevent the Board of Directors of Parent from (x) complying with either Rule 14e-2(a) under the 1934 Act or the U.K. Code, in each case, with regard to a Parent Acquisition Proposal, or (y) making any required disclosure to the shareholders of Parent, either if required by the UK Panel on Takeovers and Mergers, or otherwise if the Board of Directors of Parent determines in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel, that the failure to take such action would be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with Applicable Law; provided, that any such action or disclosure that constitutes a Parent Adverse Recommendation Change shall be made in compliance with the applicable provisions of this Section 7.02.  A “stop, look and listen” disclosure pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) under the 1934 Act in connection with a tender or exchange offer shall not constitute a Parent Adverse Recommendation Change.\\n\\n \\n\\n(c)                                  Parent shall notify the Company as promptly as practicable (but in no event later than 24 hours) after receipt by Parent (or any of its Representatives) of any Parent Acquisition Proposal or any request for information relating to Parent or any of its Subsidiaries that, to the knowledge of Parent, has been or is reasonably likely to have been made in connection with any Parent Acquisition Proposal, which notice shall be provided in writing and shall identify the Third Party making, and the material terms and conditions of, any such Parent Acquisition Proposal or request.  Parent shall thereafter (i) keep the Company reasonably informed, on a reasonably current basis, of any material changes in the status and details (or any changes to the type and amount of consideration) of any such Parent Acquisition Proposal or request and (ii) as promptly as practicable (but in no event later than 24 hours after receipt) provide to the Company copies of any material written correspondence, proposals or indications\\n\\n \\n\\n82\\n\\n \\n\\nof interest relating to the terms and conditions of such Parent Acquisition Proposal or request provided to Parent or any of its Subsidiaries (as well as written summaries of any material oral communications relating to the terms and conditions of any Parent Acquisition Proposal).\\n\\n \\n\\n(d)                                 Anything in this Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding, prior to the Parent Approval Time, in response to a Parent Acquisition Proposal that the Board of Directors of Parent determines in good faith constitutes a Parent Superior Proposal, the Board of Directors of Parent may, subject to compliance with this Section 7.02, make a Parent Adverse Recommendation Change; provided, that (A) Parent shall first notify the Company in writing at least four Business Days before taking such action that Parent intends to take such action, which notice shall include an unredacted copy of such proposal and a copy of any financing commitments (in the form provided to Parent) relating thereto (and, to the extent not in writing, the material terms and conditions thereof and the identity of the person making any such proposal), (B) Parent shall make its Representatives reasonably available to negotiate with the Company and its Representatives during such four Business Day notice period, to the extent the Company wishes to negotiate, to enable the Company to propose revisions to the terms of this Agreement such that it would cause such Parent Superior Proposal to no longer constitute a Parent Superior Proposal, (C) upon the end of such notice period, the Board of Directors of Parent shall have considered in good faith any revisions to the terms of this Agreement committed to in writing by the Company, and shall have determined that the Parent Superior Proposal would nevertheless continue to constitute a Parent Superior Proposal if the revisions committed to in writing by the Company were to be given effect and (D) in the event of any change, from time to time, to any of the financial terms or any other material terms of such Parent Superior Proposal, Parent shall, in each case, have delivered to the Company an additional notice consistent with that described in clause (A) of this proviso and a new notice period under clause (A) of this proviso shall commence each time, except each such notice period shall be three Business Days (instead of four Business Days), during which time Parent shall be required to comply with the requirements of this Section 7.02(d) anew with respect to each such additional notice, including clauses (A) through (D) above of this proviso.\\n\\n \\n\\n(e)                                  Anything in this Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding, at any time prior to the Parent Approval Time, the Board of Directors of Parent may effect a Parent Adverse Recommendation Change in response or relating to a Parent Intervening Event if the Board of Directors of Parent determines in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel, that the failure to take such action would be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under Applicable Law; provided, that (i) Parent shall first notify the Company in writing at least four Business Days before taking such action of its intention to take such action, which notice shall include a reasonably detailed description of such Parent Intervening Event, (ii) if requested by the Company, Parent shall make its Representatives reasonably available to negotiate with the Company and its Representatives during such four Business Day period following such notice regarding any proposal by the Company to amend the terms of this Agreement in response to such Parent Intervening Event, and (iii) the Board of Directors of Parent shall not effect any Parent Adverse Recommendation Change involving or relating to a Parent Intervening Event unless, after the four Business Day period described in the foregoing clause (ii), the Board of Directors of Parent determines in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel and taking into account any written commitment by the Company to amend the terms of this Agreement during such four Business Day period, that the failure to take such\\n\\n \\n\\n83\\n\\n \\n\\naction would continue to be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under Applicable Law.\\n\\n \\n\\n(f)                                   Parent shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, and shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause its and its Subsidiaries’ Representatives to, cease immediately and cause to be terminated any and all existing discussions or negotiations, if any, with any Third Party conducted prior to or ongoing as of the date of this Agreement with respect to any actual or potential (including if such discussions or negotiations were for the purpose of soliciting any) Parent Acquisition Proposal or with respect to any indication, proposal or inquiry that could reasonably be expected to lead to a Parent Acquisition Proposal and shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause any such Third Party (and any of its Representatives) in possession of confidential information about Parent or any of its Subsidiaries that was furnished by or on behalf of Parent in connection with such discussions or negotiations to return or destroy all such information.\\n\\n \\n\\nSection 7.03                             Obligations of Merger Subs.  (a) Until the First Effective Time, Bidco shall at all times be the direct owner of all of the outstanding shares of capital stock of Merger Sub I and Merger Sub II.  Parent shall take all action necessary to cause Bidco and each Merger Sub to perform its obligations under this Agreement and to consummate the Mergers on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement.  Promptly following the execution of this Agreement, Parent, in its capacity as the sole or majority stockholder of Bidco, and Bidco, in its capacity as the sole stockholder of Merger Sub I and sole member of Merger Sub II, shall each execute and deliver a written consent approving and adopting this Agreement in accordance with the DGCL and DLLCA, as applicable.\\n\\n \\n\\nSection 7.04                             Director and Officer Liability.\\n\\n \\n\\n(a)                                 For a period of not less than six years from the First Effective Time, Parent shall cause the First Surviving Corporation and the Surviving Company or any applicable Subsidiary thereof (collectively, the “D&O Indemnifying Parties”), to the fullest extent each such D&O Indemnifying Party is authorized or permitted by Applicable Law, to: (i) indemnify and hold harmless each person who is at the date of this Agreement, was previously, or during the period from the date of this Agreement through the date of the First Effective Time will be, serving as a director or officer of the Company (in the case of indemnification by the First Surviving Corporation and the Surviving Company) or any of its Subsidiaries (in the case of indemnification by such applicable Subsidiary) or, at the request or for the benefit of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, as the case may be, as a director, trustee or officer of any other entity or any benefit plan maintained by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, as the case may be (collectively, the “D&O Indemnified Parties”), as now or hereafter in effect, in connection with any D&O Claim and any losses, claims, damages, liabilities, Claim Expenses, judgments, fines, penalties and amounts paid in settlement (including all interest, assessments and other charges paid or payable in connection with or in respect of any thereof) relating to or resulting from such D&O Claim; and (ii) promptly advance to such D&O Indemnified Party any Claim Expenses incurred in defending, serving as a witness with respect to or otherwise participating with respect to any D&O Claim in advance of the final disposition of such D&O Claim, including payment on behalf of or advancement to the D&O Indemnified Party of any Claim Expenses incurred by such D&O Indemnified Party in connection with enforcing any\\n\\n \\n\\n84\\n\\n \\n\\nrights with respect to such indemnification and/or advancement, in each case without the requirement of any bond or other security, but subject to the D&O Indemnifying Party’s receipt of a written undertaking by or on behalf of such D&O Indemnified Party to repay such Claim Expenses if it is ultimately determined under Applicable Law that such D&O Indemnified Party is not entitled to be indemnified.  All rights to indemnification and advancement conferred hereunder shall continue as to a Person who has ceased to be a director or officer of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries after the date of this Agreement and shall inure to the benefit of such Person’s heirs, successors, executors and personal and legal representatives.  As used in this Section 7.04: (x) the term “D&O Claim” means any threatened, asserted, pending or completed claim, action, suit, proceeding, inquiry or investigation, whether instituted by any party hereto, any Governmental Authority or any other Person, whether civil, criminal, administrative, investigative or other, including any arbitration or other alternative dispute resolution mechanism, arising out of or pertaining to matters that relate to such D&O Indemnified Party’s duties or service (A) as a director, officer or employee of the Company or the applicable Subsidiary thereof at or prior to the First Effective Time (including with respect to any acts, facts, events or omissions occurring in connection with the approval of this Agreement, the Mergers or the consummation of the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including the consideration and approval thereof and the process undertaken in connection therewith and any D&O Claim relating thereto) or (B) as a director, trustee, officer or employee of any other entity or any benefit plan maintained by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (for which such D&O Indemnified Party is or was serving at the request or for the benefit of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries) at or prior to the First Effective Time; and (y) the term “Claim Expenses” means reasonable out-of-pocket attorneys’ fees and all other reasonable out-of-pocket costs, expenses and obligations (including experts’ fees, travel expenses, court costs, retainers, transcript fees, legal research, duplicating, printing and binding costs, as well as telecommunications, postage and courier charges) paid or incurred in connection with investigating, defending, being a witness in or participating in (including on appeal), or preparing to investigate, defend, be a witness in or participate in (including on appeal) any D&O Claim for which indemnification is authorized pursuant to this Section 7.04(a), including any action relating to a claim for indemnification or advancement brought by a D&O Indemnified Party.  No D&O Indemnifying Party shall settle, compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment in any actual or threatened D&O Claim in respect of which indemnification has been sought by such D&O Indemnified Party hereunder unless such settlement, compromise or judgment includes an unconditional release of such D&O Indemnified Party from all liability arising out of such D&O Claim, or such D&O Indemnified Party consents thereto.  Parent shall guarantee the foregoing obligations of the D&O Indemnifying Parties.\\n\\n \\n\\n(b)                                 Without limiting the foregoing, Parent agrees that all rights to indemnification, advancement of expenses and exculpation from liabilities for acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the First Effective Time now existing in favor of the current or former directors, officers or employees of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries as provided in the Company Organizational Documents, similar organizational documents of the Company’s Subsidiaries and indemnification agreements of the Company and its Subsidiaries shall survive the Mergers and shall continue in full force and effect in accordance with their terms.  For a period of not less than six years from the First Effective Time, Parent shall cause the organizational documents of the Surviving Company and its Subsidiaries to contain provisions no less favorable with respect to indemnification, advancement of expenses and limitations on\\n\\n \\n\\n85\\n\\n \\n\\nliability of directors and officers than are set forth in the Company Organizational Documents, which provisions shall not be amended, repealed or otherwise modified for a period of at least six years from the First Effective Time in any manner that would affect adversely the rights thereunder of any individuals who, at or prior to the First Effective Time, were directors, officers or employees of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries.  The Company may purchase (and pay in full the aggregate premium for) a six-year prepaid “tail” insurance policy (which policy by its express terms shall survive the Mergers) of at least the same coverage and amounts and containing terms and conditions that are no less favorable to the covered individuals as the Company’s and its Subsidiaries’ existing directors’ and officers’ insurance policy or policies with a claims period of six years from the First Effective Time for D&O Claims arising from facts, acts, events or omissions that occurred on or prior to the First Effective Time; provided, that the premium for such tail policy shall not exceed three hundred percent of the aggregate annual amounts currently paid by the Company and its Subsidiaries for such insurance (such amount being the “Maximum Premium”).  If the Company fails to obtain such tail policy prior to the First Effective Time, Parent or the Surviving Company shall obtain such a tail policy; provided, that the premium for such tail policy shall not exceed the Maximum Premium; provided, further, that if such tail policy cannot be obtained or can be obtained only by paying aggregate annual premiums in excess of the Maximum Premium, Parent, the Company or the Surviving Company shall only be required to obtain as much coverage as can be obtained by paying an annual premium equal to the Maximum Premium.  Parent and the Surviving Company shall cause any such policy (whether obtained by Parent, the Company or the Surviving Company) to be maintained in full force and effect, for its full term, and Parent shall cause the Surviving Company to honor all its obligations thereunder.\\n\\n \\n\\n(c)                                  If any of Parent or the Surviving Company or any of their respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges with or into any

that the Board of Directors of the Company has determined (which determination and subsequent distribution shall be made as promptly as practicable) in good faith after consultation with outside legal

the Company shall propose to be voted on by the stockholders of the Company at the Company Stockholder Meeting.\\n\\n \\n\\n(b)                                 As promptly as practicable following the

time to (1) solicit additional proxies necessary to obtain the Parent Shareholder Approval, or (2) distribute any supplement to the Parent Circular that the Board of Directors of Parent has determined (which determination and subsequent distribution shall be made as promptly as practicable) in good faith after consultation with outside legal counsel is necessary under Applicable Law (including Rule 10.5.4 of the Listing Rules) and for such supplement to be reviewed by Parent’s shareholders prior to the Parent Shareholder Meeting (provided, that no such postponement or adjournment under this clause (2) may be to a date that is after the earlier of (I) the 10th Business Day before the End Date and (II) the 10th Business Day after the date of such distribution), (B) due to the absence of a

sentence for a period of more than 10 Business Days on any single occasion or, on any occasion, to a date after the earlier of (x) 40 Business Days after the date on which the Parent Shareholder Meeting was originally scheduled and (y) 10 Business Days before the End Date. Without the prior written consent of the Company, the matters contemplated by the Parent Shareholder Approval shall be the only matters (other than matters of procedure and matters required by or advisable under Applicable Law to be voted on by Parent’s shareholders in connection therewith) that Parent shall propose to be voted on by the shareholders of Parent at the Parent Shareholder Meeting.\\n\\n \\n\\n(c)                                  It is the intention of the parties that, and each of the parties shall reasonably cooperate and use their commercially reasonable efforts to

provided, that the restrictions set forth in this Section 8.05 shall not apply to any release or public statement (a) made or proposed to be made by the Company in compliance with Section 6.02 with respect to the matters contemplated by Section 6.02, or made or proposed to be made by Parent in response or related to any such release or public statement that is not in violation of Section 7.02,

shall give the other party the opportunity to consult with it regarding the defense and settlement of such Transaction Litigation, shall consider in good faith the other party’s advice with respect to such Transaction Litigation and shall give the other party the opportunity to participate (at the other party’s expense) in (but not control) the defense and settlement of such Transaction

this Section 10.01(c)(ii) if Parent, Bidco or either Merger Sub is then in breach of any of its representations, warranties, covenants or agreements set forth in this Agreement, which breach by Parent, Bidco or either Merger Sub would cause any condition set forth in Section 9.03(a) or Section 9.03(b) not to be satisfied;\\n\\n \\n\\n(d)                                 by the

or warranty or failure to perform any covenant or agreement on the part of Parent, Bidco or either Merger Sub set forth in this Agreement shall have occurred that would cause any condition set forth in Section 9.03(a) or Section 9.03(b) not to be satisfied, and such breach or failure to perform (A) is incapable of being cured by the End Date or (B) has not been cured by Parent, Bidco or either Merger Sub, as applicable, within the earlier of (x) 45 days following written notice to Parent from the Company of such breach or failure to perform and (y) the End Date; provided, that this Agreement may not be terminated pursuant to this Section 10.01(d)(ii) if the Company is then in breach of any of its representations, warranties, covenants or agreements set forth in this Agreement, which breach by the Company would cause any condition set forth in Section 9.02(a) or Section 9.02(b) not to be satisfied; or\\n\\n \\n\\n(iii)                               prior to obtaining the Company Stockholder Approval, in order to enter into a definitive agreement providing for a Company Superior Proposal promptly following such termination in accordance with, and subject to the terms and conditions of, Section 6.02.\\n\\n \\n\\nThe party desiring to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 10.01 (other than pursuant to Section 10.01(a)) shall give written notice of such termination to the other party.\\n\\n \\n\\nSection 10.02                      Effect of Termination.  If this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 10.01, this Agreement shall become void and of no effect without liability of any party (or any of its Affiliates or its or their respective stockholders or shareholders, as applicable, or Representatives) to the other party hereto, except as provided in Section 10.03; provided, that, subject to Section 10.03(g), neither Parent nor the Company shall be released from any liabilities or damages arising out of any (i) fraud by any party or (ii) the Willful Breach of any covenant or agreement set forth in this Agreement.  The provisions of Section 6.03(c), the first sentence of Section 8.01(a), this Section 10.02, Section 10.03, Article XI (other than Section 11.13, except to the extent that Section 11.13 relates to the specific performance of the provisions of this Agreement that survive termination) and Section 1.01 (to the extent related to the foregoing) shall survive any termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 10.01.  In addition, the termination of this Agreement shall not affect the parties’ respective obligations under the Confidentiality Agreement.\\n\\n \\n\\n105\\n\\n \\n\\nSection 10.03                      Termination Payment.\\n\\n \\n\\n(a)                                 If this Agreement is terminated: (i) by Parent pursuant to Section 10.01(c)(i) or (ii) by the Company pursuant to Section 10.01(d)(iii), then the Company shall pay to Parent (or its designee), in cash and by way of compensation, a payment in an amount equal to $1,180,000,000 (the “Company Termination Payment”) at or prior to, and as a condition to the effectiveness of, the termination of this Agreement in the case of a termination pursuant to Section 10.01(d)(iii) or as promptly as practicable (and, in any event, within two Business Days following such termination) in the case of a termination pursuant to Section 10.01(c)(i).\\n\\n \\n\\n(b)                                 If (i) this Agreement is terminated by Parent or Company pursuant to Section 10.01(b)(iii), (ii) prior to such termination and after the date of this Agreement, a Company Acquisition Proposal shall have been publicly announced or publicly made known and shall not have been publicly withdrawn at least four Business Days prior to the Company Stockholder Meeting and (iii) on or prior to the twelve-month anniversary of such termination of this Agreement: (A) a transaction constituting a Company Acquisition Proposal is consummated; or (B) a definitive agreement relating to a Company Acquisition Proposal is entered into by the Company or any of its Affiliates (in each case, whether or not such Company Acquisition Proposal is the same as the original Company Acquisition Proposal publicly made known or publicly announced), then, the Company shall pay to Parent (or its designee) by way of compensation the Company Termination Payment no later than the consummation of such Company Acquisition Proposal; provided, that if the Company shall have actually paid the Company No Vote Payment pursuant to Section 10.03(e), then only the incremental amount between the Company No Vote Payment and the Company Termination Payment shall be payable.  “Company Acquisition Proposal” for purposes of this Section 10.03(b) shall have the meaning assigned thereto in the definition thereof set forth in Section 1.01, except that references in the definition to “20%” shall be replaced by “50%”.\\n\\n \\n\\n(c)                                  If this Agreement is terminated by the Company pursuant to Section 10.01(d)(i), Parent shall pay to the Company (or its designee), in cash and by way of compensation within three Business Days after the date of termination of this Agreement (or such other later date as the Company has notified in writing to Parent on the date of termination), a payment in an amount equal to $1,415,000,000 (the “Parent Termination Payment”), subject to any adjustment in accordance with Section 10.03(i).\\n\\n \\n\\n(d)                                 If this Agreement is terminated by the Company or Parent pursuant to Section 10.01(b)(iv), Parent shall pay to the Company (or its designee), in cash and by way of compensation within three Business Days after the date of termination of this Agreement (or such other later date as the Company has notified in writing to Parent on the date of termination), a payment in an amount equal to the Parent Termination Payment; provided, that such amount shall be payable only if either (i) the Company Stockholder Approval shall have previously been obtained or (ii) (A) the condition to termination under Section 10.01(b)(iii) has not been satisfied at the time of such termination, (B) the Company has complied with Section 8.04(c) and (C) more than 24 hours has passed since the satisfaction of the condition to termination under Section 10.01(b)(iv).\\n\\n \\n\\n106\\n\\n \\n\\n(e)                                  If this Agreement is terminated by the Company or Parent pursuant to Section 10.01(b)(iii), the Company shall pay to Parent (or its designee), in cash and by way of compensation within three Business Days after the date of termination of this Agreement, a payment in an amount equal to $270,000,000 (the “Company No Vote Payment”); provided, that such amount shall be payable only if either (i) the Parent Shareholder Approval shall have previously been obtained or (ii) (A) the condition to termination under Section 10.01(b)(iv) has not been satisfied at the time of such termination, (B) Parent has complied with Section 8.04(c) and (C) more than 24 hours has passed since the satisfaction of the condition to termination under Section 10.01(b)(iii).\\n\\n \\n\\n(f)                                   Any payment of the Company Termination Payment or the Company No Vote Payment (each, a “Company Payment”) or the Parent Termination Payment shall be made by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account designated in writing by Parent or the Company, as applicable.  Any Company Payment or Parent Termination Payment shall be made free and clear of and without deduction or withholding of any Taxes; provided:\\n\\n \\n\\n(i)                                     in the case of the Company Payment, Parent has supplied the Company with a properly completed IRS Form W-8BEN-E, on which the Company is entitled to rely, claiming the benefits of, and establishing an exemption to withholding under, the income tax treaty between the United States and the United Kingdom prior to the payment of the Company Payment;\\n\\n \\n\\n(ii)                                  in the case of the Company Payment, in the event that deductions or withholdings on account of U.S. federal income Taxes should have been made under applicable law, then Parent shall bear the cost of such Taxes;\\n\\n \\n\\n(iii)                               in the case of the Parent Termination Payment, in the event that deductions or withholdings on account of UK income Tax should have been made under applicable law, then the Company shall bear the cost of such Taxes; and\\n\\n \\n\\n(iv)                              in the case of the Parent Termination Payment, Parent may deduct or withhold any amounts in respect of VAT required or permitted to be withheld in accordance with the following provisions of this Section 10.03.\\n\\n \\n\\n(g)                                  The parties agree and understand that (x) in no event shall the Company be required to pay the Company Termination Payment on more than one occasion or the Company No Vote Payment on more than one occasion, in each case under any circumstances, and the Company No Vote Payment shall be credited toward any subsequent payment of the Company Termination Payment, and in no event shall Parent be required to pay the Parent Termination Payment on more than one occasion under any circumstances, and (y) except in the case of fraud or Willful Breach by the other party of any covenant or agreement set forth in this Agreement, in no event shall Parent be entitled, pursuant to this Section 10.03, to receive an amount greater than the Company Termination Payment and Company No Vote Payment, as applicable (subject to the understanding that the Company No Vote Payment is set off against the Company Termination Payment when the payment of the Company Termination Payment follows the payment of the Company No Vote Payment under Section 10.03(e)), and any applicable additional amounts pursuant to the last two sentences of this Section 10.03(g) (such\\n\\n \\n\\n107\\n\\n \\n\\nadditional amounts, collectively, the “Parent Additional Amounts”), and in no event shall the Company be entitled, pursuant to this Section 10.03, to receive an amount greater than the Parent Termination Payment and any applicable additional amounts pursuant to Section 6.03(c) and/or the last two sentences of this Section 10.3(g) (such additional amounts, collectively, the “Company Additional Amounts”).  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, except in the case of fraud or Willful Breach by the other party of any covenant or agreement set forth in this Agreement, (i) if Parent receives a Company Payment and any applicable Parent Additional Amounts from the Company pursuant to this Section 10.03, or if the Company receives the Parent Termination Payment and any applicable Company Additional Amounts from Parent pursuant to this Section 10.03, such payment shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of the receiving party against the paying party and its Subsidiaries and their respective former, current or future partners, equityholders, managers, members, Affiliates and Representatives, and none of the paying party, any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective former, current or future partners, equityholders, managers, members, Affiliates or Representatives shall have any further liability or obligation, in each case relating to or arising out of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby and (ii) if (A) Parent, Bidco or either Merger Sub receives any payments from the Company in respect of any breach of this Agreement and thereafter Parent receives a Company Payment pursuant to this Section 10.03 or (B) the Company receives any payments from Parent, Bidco or either Merger Sub in respect of any breach of this Agreement and thereafter the Company receives the Parent Termination Payment, the amount of such Company Termination Payment or such Parent Termination Payment, as applicable, shall be reduced by the aggregate amount of such payments made by the party paying the Company Payment or the Parent Termination Payment, as applicable, in respect of any such breaches (in each case, after taking into account any Parent Additional Amounts or Company Additional Amounts, as applicable).  The parties acknowledge that the agreements contained in this Section 10.03 are an integral part of the transactions contemplated hereby, that, without these agreements, the parties would not enter into this Agreement and that any amounts payable pursuant to this Section 10.03 do not constitute a penalty.  Accordingly, if any party fails to promptly pay any Company Payment or the Parent Termination Payment due pursuant to this Section 10.03, such party shall also pay any out-of-pocket costs and expenses (together with any irrecoverable VAT incurred thereon, and including reasonable legal fees and expenses) incurred by the party entitled to such payment in connection with a legal action to enforce this Agreement that results in a judgment for such amount against the party failing to promptly pay such amount.  Any Company Payment or Parent Termination Payment not paid when due pursuant to this Section 10.03 shall bear interest from the date such amount is due until the date paid at a rate equal to the prime rate as published in The Wall Street Journal, Eastern Edition in effect on the date of such payment.\\n\\n \\n\\n(h)                                 The Parent Termination Payment and the Company Termination Payment (in each case if any) shall be VAT inclusive.\\n\\n \\n\\n(i)                                     The parties hereto intend that any payment of a Parent Termination Payment, being compensatory in nature, shall not be treated (in whole or in part) as consideration for a supply for the purposes of VAT and, accordingly, Parent shall:\\n\\n \\n\\n(i)                                     file its relevant VAT return on the basis that the payment of any such Parent Termination Payment falls outside the scope of VAT; and\\n\\n \\n\\n108\\n\\n \\n\\n(ii)                                  pay the full amount of any such Parent Termination Payment free and clear of any deduction or adjustment on account of VAT,\\n\\n \\n\\nit being understood and agreed that if it is finally determined that the Parent Termination Payment is (in whole or in part) consideration for a supply for the purposes of VAT then:\\n\\n \\n\\n(A)                              Parent shall (1) subject to having received the relevant amount from the Company as provided in sub-clause (C) below, promptly account for and pay to HMRC such VAT together with any associated interest and penalties; and (2) use its reasonable best efforts to recover (by refund, credit or otherwise) any such VAT at the residual recovery rate generally applied by Parent in respect of input VAT incurred on its overheads from time to time;\\n\\n \\n\\n(B)                               the amount of the Parent Termination Payment payable by Parent shall be reduced so that the sum of (1) the Parent Termination Payment (as so reduced) and (2) any VAT reverse charge thereon that Parent certifies acting in good faith that it is not entitled to recover (by way of credit or repayment) as input tax (together with any related interest or penalties in respect of such VAT reverse charge but excluding any interest or penalties arising as a result of the unreasonable delay or default of Parent), is equal to the amount of the Parent Termination Payment that would be payable but for this subclause (B) (the amount of such reduction being the “Adjustment Amount”); and\\n\\n \\n\\n(C)                               the Company covenants to pay to Parent on written demand and on an after-Tax basis an amount equal to the Adjustment Amount save to the extent that such Adjustment Amount has previously been adjusted by way of refund of such part of the Parent Termination Payment, the due date for payment of which shall be five Business Days after the date such written demand is received by the Company.\\n\\n \\n\\nThis section 10.03(i) is subject to the provisions of Section 10.03(i) of the Company Disclosure Schedule.\\n\\n \\n\\n(j)                                    Any reference in Section 10.03(i) or Section 10.03(i) of the Company Disclosure Schedule to Parent shall where applicable be regarded as referring to the representative member of any VAT group of which Parent is a member, and “finally determined” shall mean determined by HMRC or, if such determination is appealed, a court or tribunal in a decision or judgment in respect of which no right of appeal exists (or in relation to which any periods for appeal have expired) or, whether or not such determination is appealed, as provided in a binding agreement made with HMRC.\\n\\n \\n\\n(k)                                 The parties anticipate that any Company Payment shall be outside the scope of UK VAT and not otherwise subject to VAT.\\n\\n \\n\\n109\\n\\n \\n\\n(l)                                     For the purposes of Section 10.03(i)(ii)(C), and Section 10.03(i) of the Company Disclosure Schedule, a covenant or indemnity being given on an “after-Tax basis” means that the amount payable (the “Payment”) pursuant to such covenant or indemnity (as applicable) shall be calculated in such a manner as will ensure that, after taking into account: (A) any Tax required to be deducted or withheld from the Payment (save to the extent that Parent has not provided a W-8BEN-E when it was entitled to do so, and provision of a W-8BEN-E would have prevented such deduction or withholding being required) and any additional amounts required to be paid by the payer of the Payment in consequence of such withholding; (B) the amount and timing of any additional Tax which becomes (or would become, but for the use of any credit or other relief which would otherwise have been available to reduce the Tax liabilities of any member of the recipient’s Group) payable by the recipient of the Payment as a result of the Payment’s being chargeable to Tax in the hands of that person; and (C) the amount and timing of any Tax benefit which is obtained by the recipient of the Payment (or any member of the recipient’s Group) to the extent that such Tax benefit is attributable to the matter giving rise to the obligation to make the Payment or the receipt of the Payment, the recipient of the Payment is in the same position as that in which it would have been if the matter giving rise to the obligation to make a Payment under this Section 10.03(l) had not occurred, provided that if any party to this Agreement shall have assigned or novated the benefit of this Agreement in whole or in part or shall, after the date of this Agreement, have changed its Tax residence or the permanent establishment to which the rights under this Agreement are allocated then no Payment to that party shall be increased by reason of the operation of clauses (A) through (C) (inclusive) to any greater extent than would have been the case had no such assignment, novation or change taken place.  In this Section 10.03(l), references to “Tax” shall exclude “VAT” and references to a “W-8BEN-E” shall mean a properly completed IRS Form W-8BEN-E, on which the Company is entitled to rely, claiming the benefits of, and establishing an exemption to withholding under, the income tax treaty between the United States and the United Kingdom prior to such Payment.\\n\\n \\n\\n(m)                             None of the Financing Sources shall have any liability to the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or any Person that is an Affiliate of the Company prior to giving effect to the Mergers relating to or arising out of this Agreement or the Debt Financing, whether at law, or equity, in contract, in tort or otherwise, and neither the Company nor any Person that is an Affiliate of the Company prior to giving effect to the Mergers shall have any rights or claims directly against any of the Financing Sources hereunder or thereunder.  The foregoing shall not impair, supplement, or otherwise modify any of the commitments and other obligations that the Financing Sources have under any definitive agreement related to the Debt Financing to Parent, Bidco or either Merger Sub or any of the rights of Parent, Bidco or either Merger Sub against any of the Financing Sources under any definitive agreement related to the Debt Financing.\\n\\n \\n\\nARTICLE XI\\n\\n \\n\\nMISCELLANEOUS\\n\\n \\n\\nSection 11.01

Governing Law.  This Agreement, and all disputes, claims, actions, suits or proceedings based upon, arising out of or related to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, shall be
