In the event that the action which is consented to is such as would have required the filing of a certificate\\nunder any provision of the DGCL, if such action had been voted on by stockholders at a meeting thereof, the certificate filed under such provision shall state, in lieu of any statement required by such provision concerning any vote of stockholders,\\nthat written consent has been given in accordance with Section 228 of the DGCL.\",\"1.10\",\"Record Dates\",\".

If the Board so fixes a date, such date shall also be the record date for determining the stockholders entitled to\\nvote at such meeting unless the Board determines, at the time it fixes such record date, that a later date on or before the date of the meeting shall be the date for making such determination.\",\"If no record date is fixed by the Board, the record date for determining stockholders entitled to notice of and to vote at a meeting of\\nstockholders shall be at the close of business on the day next preceding the day on which notice is given, or, if notice is waived, at the close of business on the day next preceding the day on which the meeting is held.\",\"A determination of stockholders of record entitled to notice of or to vote at a meeting of stockholders shall apply to any adjournment of the\\nmeeting;\",\"provided, however,\",\"that the Board may fix a new record date for determination of stockholders entitled to vote at the adjourned meeting, and in such case shall also fix as the record date for stockholders entitled to notice of such\\nadjourned meeting the same or an earlier date as that fixed for determination of stockholders entitled to vote in accordance with the provisions of Section 213 of the DGCL and this Section 1.10 at the adjourned meeting.\",\"4\",\"In order that the Company may determine the stockholders entitled to consent to corporate\\naction in writing without a meeting, the Board may fix a record date, which record date shall not precede the date upon which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted by the Board, and which date shall not be more than 10 days after the date\\nupon which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted by the Board. If no record date has been fixed by the Board, the record date for determining stockholders entitled to consent to corporate action in writing without a meeting, when no prior\\naction by the Board is required by law, shall be the first date on which a signed written consent setting forth the action taken or proposed to be taken is delivered to the Company in accordance with applicable law. If no record date has been fixed\\nby the Board and prior action by the Board is required by law, the record date for determining stockholders entitled to consent to corporate action in writing without a meeting shall be at the close of business on the day on which the Board adopts\\nthe resolution taking such prior action.\",\"In order that the Company may determine the stockholders entitled to receive payment of any\\ndividend or other distribution or allotment of any rights or the stockholders entitled to exercise any rights in respect of any change, conversion or exchange of stock, or for the purpose of any other lawful action, the Board may fix a record date,\\nwhich record date shall not precede the date upon which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted, and which record date shall be not more than 60 days prior to such action. If no record date is fixed, the record date for determining\\nstockholders for any such purpose shall be at the close of business on the day on which the Board adopts the resolution relating thereto.\",\"1.11\",\"Proxies\",\". Each stockholder entitled to vote at a meeting of stockholders or to express consent or dissent to\\ncorporate action in writing without a meeting may authorize another person or persons to act for such stockholder by proxy authorized by an instrument in writing or by a transmission permitted by law filed in accordance with the procedure\\nestablished for the meeting, but no such proxy shall be voted or acted upon after three years from its date, unless the proxy provides for a longer period. The revocability of a proxy that states on its face that it is irrevocable shall be governed\\nby the provisions of Section 212 of the DGCL.\",\"1.12\",\"List of Stockholders Entitled to Vote\",\". The officer who has\\ncharge of the stock ledger of the Company shall prepare and make, at least ten days before every meeting of stockholders, a complete list of the stockholders entitled to vote at the meeting;\",\"provided, however,\",\"if the record date for\\ndetermining the stockholders entitled to vote is less than 10 days before the meeting date, the list shall reflect the stockholders entitled to vote as of the tenth day before the meeting date, arranged in alphabetical order, and showing the address\\nof each stockholder and the number of shares registered in the name of each stockholder. The Company shall not be required to include electronic mail addresses or other electronic contact information on such list. Such list shall be open to the\\nexamination of any stockholder for any purpose germane to the meeting for a period of at least ten days prior to the meeting: (i) on a reasonably accessible electronic network,\",\"provided\",\"that the information required to gain access to\\nsuch list is provided with the notice of the meeting, or (ii) during ordinary business hours, at the Company’s principal place of business. In the event that the Company determines to make the list available on an electronic network, the\\nCompany may take reasonable steps to ensure that such information is available only to stockholders of the Company. If the meeting is to be held at a place, then the list shall be produced and kept at the time and place of the meeting during the\\nwhole time thereof, and may be examined by any stockholder who is present. If the meeting is to be held solely by means of remote communication, then the list shall also be open to the examination of any stockholder during the whole time of the\\nmeeting on a reasonably accessible electronic network, and the information required to access such list shall be provided with the notice of the meeting.\",\"5\",\"ARTICLE II — DIRECTORS\",\"2.1\",\"Powers\",\".

The Board shall\\nconsist of one or more members, each of whom shall be a natural person. Unless the certificate of incorporation fixes the number of directors, the number of directors shall be determined from time to time by resolution of the Board.

Except as provided in\",\"section\",\"2.4\",\"of these bylaws, and subject to\",\"sections 1.2\",\"and\",\"1.9\",\"of these bylaws, directors shall be elected at each annual meeting of stockholders.

The certificate of incorporation or these bylaws may prescribe other qualifications for directors. Each director shall hold office until such director’s successor is elected and qualified or\\nuntil such director’s earlier death, resignation or removal.\",\"2.4\",\"Resignation and Vacancies\",\". Any director may\\nresign at any time upon notice given in writing or by electronic transmission to the Company.

Whenever\\nnotice is required to be given, under the DGCL, the certificate of incorporation or these bylaws, to any person with whom communication is unlawful, the giving of such notice to such person shall not be required and there shall be no duty to apply\\nto any governmental authority or agency for a license or permit to give such notice to such person. Any action or meeting which shall be taken or held without notice to any such person with whom communication is unlawful shall have the same force\\nand effect as if such notice had been duly given. In the event that the action taken by the Company is such as to require the filing of a certificate under the DGCL, the certificate shall state, if such is the fact and if notice is required, that\\nnotice was given to all persons entitled to receive notice except such persons with whom communication is unlawful.\",\"7.5\",\"Waiver of Notice\",\". Whenever notice is required to be given under any provision of the DGCL, the certificate of incorporation or these bylaws, a written waiver, signed by the person entitled to notice, or a waiver by electronic\\ntransmission by the person entitled to notice, whether before or after the time of the event for which notice is to be given, shall be deemed equivalent to notice. Attendance of a person at a meeting shall constitute a waiver of notice of such\\nmeeting, except when the person attends a meeting for the express purpose of objecting at the beginning of the meeting, to the transaction of any business because the meeting is not lawfully called or convened. Neither the business to be transacted\\nat, nor the purpose of, any regular or special meeting of the stockholders need be specified in any written waiver of notice or any waiver by electronic transmission unless so required by the certificate of incorporation or these bylaws.\",\"ARTICLE VIII — GENERAL MATTERS\",\"8.1\",\"Fiscal Year\",\". The fiscal year of the Company shall be fixed by resolution of the Board and may be changed by the\\nBoard.\",\"8.2\",\"Seal\",\".\",\"The Company may adopt a corporate seal, which shall be in such form as may be\\napproved from time to time by the Board. The Company may use the corporate seal by causing it or a facsimile thereof to be impressed or affixed or in any other manner reproduced.\",\"8.3\",\"Annual Report\",\". The Company shall cause an annual report to be sent to the stockholders of the Company to the extent\\nrequired by applicable law. If and so long as there are fewer than 100 holders of record of the Company’s shares, the requirement of sending an annual report to the stockholders of the Company is expressly waived (to the extent permitted under\\napplicable law).\",\"8.4\",\"Construction; Definitions\",\". Unless the context requires otherwise, the general provisions, rules\\nof construction, and definitions in the DGCL shall govern the construction of these bylaws. Without limiting the generality of this provision, the singular number includes the plural, the plural number includes the singular, and the term\\n“\",\"person\",\"” includes both a corporation and a natural person.\",\"ARTICLE IX — AMENDMENTS\",\"These bylaws may be adopted, amended or repealed by the stockholders entitled to vote. However, the Company may, in its certificate of\\nincorporation, confer the power to adopt, amend or repeal bylaws upon the directors. The fact that such power has been so conferred upon the directors shall not divest the stockholders of the power, nor limit their power to adopt, amend or repeal\\nbylaws.\",\"18\",\"A bylaw amendment adopted by stockholders which specifies the votes that shall be necessary\\nfor the election of directors shall not be further amended or repealed by the Board.\",\"19\",\"<img
