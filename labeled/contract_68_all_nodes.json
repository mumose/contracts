Such notice shall state, among other things, the following:\",\"(1)\",\"that a Change of Control has occurred and that such Holder has the right to require the Issuer to purchase such\\nHolder’s Notes at a purchase price in cash equal to 101% of the principal amount thereof on the date of purchase, plus unpaid accrued interest, if any, to the date of purchase (subject to the right of Holders of record on the relevant record\\ndate to receive interest on the relevant interest payment date);\",\"(2)\",\"the purchase date (which shall be no earlier than 30 days nor later than 60 days from the date such notice is\\nmailed; such purchase date, the “\",\"Change of Control Payment Date\",\"”); and\",\"(3)\",\"the instructions, as determined by the Issuer, consistent with the covenant described hereunder, that a Holder\\nmust follow in order to have its Notes purchased.\",\"Holders electing to have a Note purchased pursuant to a Change of\\nControl Offer will be required to surrender the Note, with the form entitled “Option of Holder to Elect Purchase” on the reverse of the Note completed, to the Paying Agent for the Notes at the address specified in the notice prior to the\\nclose of business on the third Business Day prior to the Change of Control Payment Date. If the Change of Control Payment Date is on or after an interest record date and on or before the related interest payment date, any accrued and unpaid interest\\nwill be paid to the Person in whose name a Note is registered at the close of business on the record date, and no additional interest will be payable to holders who tender pursuant to the Change of Control Offer.\",\"The Issuer will not be required to make a Change of Control Offer following a Change of Control Triggering Event if (i) a third party\\nmakes the Change of Control Offer in the manner, at the times and otherwise in compliance with the requirements set forth in the Indenture applicable to a Change of Control Offer made by the Issuer and purchases all Notes validly tendered and not\\nwithdrawn under such Change of Control Offer, (ii) notice of redemption of all Notes has been given pursuant to the Indenture as described above under the caption “—Optional Redemption,” unless there is a default in payment of\\nthe applicable redemption price or (iii) in connection with or in contemplation of any Change of Control, the Issuer has made an offer to purchase (an “\",\"Alternate Offer\",\"”) any and all Notes validly tendered at a cash price equal\\nto or higher than the Change of Control Payment and has purchased all Notes properly tendered in accordance with the terms of such Alternate Offer.\",\"Any Change of Control Offer may be made in advance of a Change of Control, and, at the Issuer’s discretion, conditioned upon the\\noccurrence of such Change of Control, if a definitive agreement is in effect for the Change of Control at the time of making the Change of Control Offer.\",\"If a Change of Control Offer is made, there can be no assurance that the Issuer will have available funds sufficient to pay the Change of\\nControl Payment for all the Notes that might be delivered by Holders seeking to accept the Change of Control Offer. Other debt securities that the Issuer may issue in the future that rank equally in right of payment with the Notes, may have similar\\nrights. If the Issuer is required to purchase outstanding Notes or such other Indebtedness pursuant to a Change of Control Offer, the Issuer expects that it would seek third-party\",\"44\",\"financing to the extent it does not have available funds to meet its purchase obligations.

In\\naddition, the Issuer may be required to obtain a waiver or amendment under the Senior Credit Facility to permit the repurchase of the Notes. The Issuer cannot assure you that it could obtain such a waiver or amendment. Additionally, the occurrence\\nof certain change of control events identified in the Senior Credit Facility would constitute an event of default under the Senior Credit Facility which would permit the lenders thereunder to accelerate all indebtedness under the Senior Credit\\nFacility. The failure of the Issuer to make or consummate the Change of Control Offer or pay the required amount for any Notes tendered and not withdrawn when due will constitute a Default under the Indenture and will otherwise give the Trustee and\\nthe Holders the rights described under “—Events of Default.” See [“Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the Notes—We may not be able to repurchase the notes upon a change of control as required by the indenture governing the\\nnotes.”]\",\"Restrictions in the Indenture described herein on the ability of the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries to incur\\nadditional Indebtedness, to grant Liens on their property, to make Restricted Payments, to engage in mergers or similar transactions and to make Asset Sales may also make more difficult or discourage a takeover of the Issuer, whether favored or\\nopposed by the management of the Issuer. Consummation of any such transaction in certain circumstances may require repurchase of the Notes, and there can be no assurance that the Issuer or the acquiring party will have sufficient financial resources\\nto effect such repurchase. Such restrictions and the restrictions on transactions with Affiliates may, in certain circumstances, make more difficult or discourage any leveraged buyout of the Issuer by the management of the Issuer. While such\\nrestrictions cover a wide variety of arrangements which have traditionally been used to effect highly leveraged transactions, the Indenture may not afford the Holders protection in all circumstances from the adverse aspects of a highly leveraged\\ntransaction, reorganization, restructuring, merger or similar transaction.\",\"The Change of Control purchase feature of the Notes may in\\ncertain circumstances make more difficult or discourage a sale or takeover of the Issuer and, thus, the removal of incumbent management. The Change of Control purchase feature is a result of negotiations between the Issuer and the initial\\npurchasers. The Issuer has no present intention to engage in a transaction involving a Change of Control, although it is possible that the Issuer could decide to do so in the future.\",\"A Change of Control Offer shall remain open for a period of 20 Business Days or such longer period as may be required by law. The Issuer will\\ncomply with the requirements of Rule\",\"14e-1\",\"under the Exchange Act and any other securities laws and regulations thereunder to the extent such laws and regulations are applicable in connection with the\\nrepurchase of Notes pursuant to a Change of Control Offer. To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations conflict with the “Change of Control” provisions of the Indenture, the Issuer shall comply with the\\napplicable securities laws and regulations and shall not be deemed to have breached its obligations under the “Change of Control” provisions of the Indenture by virtue thereof.\",\"The definition of Change of Control includes a phrase relating to the sale, lease, exchange or other transfer of “all or substantially\\nall” of the properties or assets of the Issuer. Although there is a limited body of case law interpreting the phrase “substantially all,” there is no precise established definition of the phrase under applicable law. Accordingly, the\\nability of a Holder to require the Issuer to repurchase its Notes as a result of a sale, lease, exchange or other transfer of less than all of the assets of the issuer to another Person or group may be uncertain.\",\"In the event that upon consummation of a Change of Control Offer or Alternate Offer less than 10% of the aggregate principal amount of the\\nNotes (including, without limitation, Additional Notes, if any) that were originally issued are held by Holders other than the Issuer or Affiliates thereof, the Issuer will have the right, upon not less than 10 nor more than 60 days prior notice,\\ngiven not more than 60 days following the purchase pursuant to the Change of Control Offer described above, to redeem all of the Notes that remain outstanding following such purchase at a redemption price equal to the Change of Control Payment plus,\\nto the extent not included in the Change of Control Payment, accrued and unpaid interest, if any, on the Notes that remain outstanding, to the date of redemption, subject to the rights of holders of Notes on the relevant record date to receive\\ninterest on the relevant interest payment date.\",\"The provisions under the Indenture relative to the Issuer’s obligation to make an\\noffer to repurchase the Notes as a result of a Change of Control Triggering Event may be waived or modified or terminated with the consent of the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Notes (including any Additional Notes) then\\noutstanding (including consents obtained in connection with a purchase of, or tender offer or exchange offer for, Notes).\",\"45\",\"Certain Covenants\",\"Covenant Suspension\",\"During any\\nperiod of time that (a) the Notes have an Investment Grade Rating and (b) no Event of Default has occurred and is continuing under the Indenture, the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries will not be subject to the provisions of the\\nIndenture described under:\",\"•\",\"“—Limitation on Incurrence of Additional Indebtedness and Issuance of Preferred Stock”;\",\"•\",\"“—Limitation on Restricted Payments”;\",\"•\",\"“—Limitation on Asset Sales”;\",\"•\",\"“—Limitation on Dividend and Other Payment Restrictions Affecting Restricted Subsidiaries”;\",\"•\",\"Clauses (2) and (3) of the first paragraph and clause (3) of the fourth paragraph of “Merger,\\nConsolidation and Sale of Assets”;\",\"•\",\"“—Limitation on Transactions with Affiliates”; and\",\"•\",\"“—Subsidiary Guarantors.”\",\"If the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries are not subject to these covenants for any period of time as a result of the\\nprevious sentence (a “\",\"Fall-Away Period\",\"”) and, subsequently, the ratings assigned to the Notes are withdrawn or downgraded so the Notes no longer have an Investment Grade Rating, then the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries will\\nthereafter again be subject to these covenants. The ability of the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries to make Restricted Payments after the time of such withdrawal or downgrade will be calculated as if the covenant governing Restricted Payments\\nhad been in effect during the entire period of time from the Issue Date.

You may hold your beneficial interests in the Global Notes directly through DTC if you have an account with DTC or indirectly\\nthrough organizations that have accounts with DTC.\",\"DTC has advised us that it is:\",\"•\",\"a limited purpose trust company organized under the laws of the State of New York;\",\"•\",\"a “banking organization” within the meaning of the New York State Banking Law;\",\"•\",\"a member of the Federal Reserve System;\",\"•\",\"a “clearing corporation” within the meaning of the Uniform Commercial Code; and\",\"•\",\"a “clearing agency” registered under Section 17A of the Exchange Act.\",\"66\",\"DTC was created to hold securities for its participants and to facilitate the clearance and\\nsettlement of securities transactions between its participants through electronic book-entry changes to the accounts of its participants. DTC’s participants include securities brokers and dealers, including the initial purchasers; banks and\\ntrust companies; clearing corporations and other organizations. Indirect access to DTC’s system is also available to others such as banks, brokers, dealers and trust companies; these indirect participants clear through or maintain a custodial\\nrelationship with a DTC participant, either directly or indirectly. Investors who are not DTC participants may beneficially own securities held by or on behalf of DTC only through DTC participants or indirect participants in DTC.\",\"So long as DTC’s nominee is the registered owner of the Global Notes, that nominee will be considered the sole owner or holder of the\\nNotes represented by the Global Notes for all purposes under the Indentures.

Payments of principal, premium (if any) and interest with respect to the Notes represented by a Global Note will be made by the trustee to DTC’s nominee as the\\nregistered holder of the Global Note. We understand that under existing industry practice, in the event an owner of a beneficial interest in a Global Note desires to take any action that the DTC, as the holder of the Global Note, is entitled to\\ntake, the DTC would authorize the participants to take such action, and the participants would authorize beneficial owners owning through such participants to take such action or would otherwise act upon the instructions of beneficial owners owning\\nthrough them.\",\"We will make payments of principal of, premium, if any, and interest on Notes represented by the Global Notes registered in\\nthe name of and held by the DTC or its nominee to the DTC or its nominee, as the case may be, as the registered owner and holder of the Global Notes. We expect that the DTC or its nominee, upon receipt of any payment of principal of, premium, if\\nany, or interest on the Global Notes will credit participants’ accounts with payments in amounts proportionate to their respective beneficial interests in the principal amount of the Global Notes as shown on the records of the DTC or its\\nnominee. We also expect that payments by participants or indirect participants to owners of beneficial interests in the Global Notes held through such participants or indirect participants will be governed by standing instructions and customary\\npractices and will be the responsibility of such participants or indirect participants. We will not have any responsibility or liability for any aspect of the records relating to, or payments made on account of, beneficial ownership interests in the\\nGlobal Notes for any Note or for maintaining, supervising or reviewing any records relating to such beneficial ownership interests or for any other aspect of the relationship between the DTC and its participants or indirect participants or the\\nrelationship between such participants or indirect participants and the owners of beneficial interests in the Global Notes owning through such participants. Transfers between participants in DTC will be effected under DTC’s procedures and will\\nbe settled in\",\"same-day\",\"funds.\",\"Although the DTC has agreed to the foregoing procedures in order to\\nfacilitate transfers of interests in the Global Notes among participants of the DTC, it is under no obligation to perform or continue to perform such procedures, and such procedures may be discontinued at any time. Neither the Trustee nor the Issuer\\nwill have any responsibility or liability for the performance by the DTC or its participants or indirect participants of their respective obligations under the rules and procedures governing their operations or otherwise.\",\"Definitions\",\"Set forth below is a summary\\nof certain of the defined terms to be used in the Indenture.
