promptly to pay the amount due pursuant to this Section 8.2,\\nand, in order to obtain such payment, the other party commences a suit which results in a judgment against the\",\"non-paying\",\"party for the Termination Fee or any portion thereof, such\",\"non-paying\",\"party shall pay the costs and expenses of the other party (including reasonable attorneys’ fees and expenses) in connection with

The amounts payable by Flagstar and NYCB\\npursuant to Section 8.2(b) and Section 8.2(c), respectively, and this Section 8.2(e), constitute liquidated damages and not a penalty, and, except in the case of Fraud or Willful Breach, shall be the sole monetary remedy of the other\\nparty in the event of a termination of this Agreement specified in such applicable section.\",\"-63-\",\"ARTICLE IX\",\"GENERAL PROVISIONS\",\"9.1\",\"Amendment\",\".
